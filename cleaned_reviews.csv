Rating 1 out of 5,"This is the most difficult review I’ve ever written. So much so I had 4 attempts at writing it, and in the end scaled back much of what I wanted to say (including 17 of my most important themes and issues), to just a core few. Unlike Harry I deliberately tried to moderate what I have to say, which is incredibly challenging when reviewing this memoir. It is also especially challenging but important to keep your review concentrated on what is actually written in this book (including its publicity) and for that reason, I have made great efforts to set aside what I know and what I'm hearing, because to review this honestly it is important to ignore the rumour mill and the other news stories, and set aside your own perceptions. So my comments are based on what Harry has written in his book and in part his media circus surrounding its publication. All in the name of privacy.The reality is this. I too can highlight the many holes and inaccuracies in Harry’s stories, dates, and his own conflicting verbiage. I too can lash out at his many frivolous and insulting remarks that were so unnecessary and excruciatingly petty. I too can argue that many of Harry’s claims are based on his perception and personal choice and do not come with a fact base or credible evidence. However, my dislike of this fictional story goes much deeper, is much more fundamental and gets to the heart of someone’s character, their motives, and principles or lack of. Now you can see why I struggled with this so much, yet much of my own personal views will remain private.Regardless of which side you take on this, everyone that cares enough will find this all very sad. I am sure there are lessons to be learned on all sides in this family saga, and no shortage of regrets. Yet one thing I know for sure, we will never get to the real truth because one side will not resort to the petty and sometimes damaging allegations made by Harry, in this book. So William is nothing but an easy open target because he is part of an establishment that “never complains and never explains”, even when his wife is subjected to abuse from the media (much more than Meghan over the years).The themes and core issuesWhose privacy rules and standards do we follow and when? By writing this book Harry has sought worldwide media attention. He has signed a multiple book deal, featured in the Netflix series and engaged in a number of nonchallenging interviews, which is completely contrary to what he espouses which is privacy. And by doing so he has denied the Royal Family the privacy he supposedly craves. He has broken the privacy rules with regards to the late Queen, the now King, the future King, his stepmother, his sister-in-law, his friends, wider family, and his army colleagues - just about everyone really and that I find incredibly hypocritical. He even has the audacity to complain about his mother’s former butler, Paul Burrell, in the book when he is doing much worse- in his book. This is sheer hypocrisy on a monumental scale. Whose safety do you really care about? The second issue I have is that Harry left the UK to allegedly keep his family safe. I say allegedly because the narrative keeps changing. Even after reading the book, I am still unclear what the current version of events are and what his story is today. At what point will he be or was he telling the truth? Here is my deep concern. By publishing a kill count of 25 Taliban fighter’s aka chess pieces (in his own words) he has increased the risk to himself, his family, and many others in military service. I find this abhorrent and immoral, because every death is someone’s child, father, brother, or friend, and even in war we should respect that. What prudent person publishes a tally? My GR friends may recall, I recently read Diamond Eye, where the MC was a female sniper and whilst a heroine in the eyes of many, she actually kept a body count of her kills which did not sit well with me, for the same reason. Respect. Who does that? Yet once again Harry takes no responsibility and has since tried to change the narrative by blaming the press for manipulating his words despite the fact that this sordid comment is written by him in his own memoir. Diana had two sons, remember that when reading this story. I for one will always remember the heart-breaking image of Diana’s two sons walk behind their mother’s coffin. A life changing event for the boys she loved, which caused mental health issues for BOTH sons growing up, something they jointly opened up about and campaign for. Yet Harry does this publicly to William. Whilst the pain is evident in Harry's story, I ask myself, what mother, and particularly Diana, would be pleased and supportive of a son who has consciously and deliberately set out on a campaign to work against the other. By writing a book that will be forever in print and with allegations that don’t stack up in my opinion, Harry has created this impossible situation for Diana’s eldest son, knowing that William won’t or can’t respond. Does Harry believe that the mother he refers to often in the book would be proud?. William is a soft open target for Harry, which is why I have lost so much respect for Harry having taken this course of action. It would appear he is emotionally obtuse or ill advised or both. Either way someone is on the receiving end and its Diana's eldest son who she was very protective off as the future King. A life she knew would be dedicated to 'service' and 'duty' while Harry had much less restrictions and more freedom. See here is the different lens to 'Spare'.Have you ever tried to warn a family member against their choice? It is not easy but what does a loving sibling do when you have deep concerns? You do what William did - voice your reservations, but unfortunately, this seems to be what sits behind much of this sorry affair. Harry doesn’t want to hear or accept it. From what Harry has shared it would appear these conversations did not go well, and neither son comes out blameless, particularly the one when William allegedly grips Harry’s shirt. A lesson I hope all will learn from. Time will tell who was right though.There was one point in this whole saga that had me seething and sad and its when Harry claims that William recently says …I love you, Harry, on our mothers life I love you… God you can hear the anguish felt by William in those words. Yet Harry admits to throwing it back in William’s face, and then this guy claims he wants a reconciliation. Sorry Harry, as was your response - I don’t believe you and bleep bleep to the rest of what you said here. Disgraceful.I’m in a minority here on GR, by rating this a ‘1’ because most people I know who have a problem with Harry’s behaviour, integrity, and motives for writing this book have chosen not to waste their money or time on it. Which potentially provides a distorted view of UK public opinion, in particular.Comments about the book’s writing style and structureHad Harry thought about what he wanted to achieve from the book, he might have structured the book differently and placed greater emphasis on what was important for us to hear and what was important for the narrative he wanted to share. Instead this came across as an emotional download and mental dump of Harry’s lifelong grievances, and aimed at anyone who had an opposing view. This does not make him a victim, instead the pendulum swung the other way and this overload for the reader just painted him as vengeful and spoilt in my eyes. Yet we do know from our own history that Harry had some genuine issues with the press for example (the press also managed his image during his years of alcohol and drug abuse -which he admits to in the book) but all this was lost amongst so much needless complaints and insults directed towards others, and I just reached saturation point, with little accountability accepted or owned by Harry.Let me explain what I mean about having an objective. For example, if you wanted reconciliation then share the wrongs in a considered and constructive way and explain what it is you hope to fix and then let your actions support that. If you want the world to know you are at peace with yourself, then remove these rantings, because this book has achieved the opposite. If this story was to expose the media as part of your unwinnable war against the press, then why attack William the way you have?. By trying so hard to paint himself as victim, he created too many so called ‘enemies’ that in the end you could see why some people like me could conclude that the common problem here is in fact …. Harry. I am deliberately leaving Meghan out of this review.In terms of writing style, the book felt as though it was written by many different authors. Clipped sentences were replaced with more descriptive prose and much longer sentences, which seemed at odds with a book that had so many chapters. However, it was a stroke of genius to narrate your own story. A very clever marketing accomplishment that no doubt will have lured people and captured the sympathy of many readers. Even I was moved in the early chapters when I relived Diana’s death in particular, but when the venom kicked in and the objectivity was notably missing. Harry lost me.Had a level of sensitivity and maturity been applied to this story I might have responded differently. Had he shown some restraint and not made such unnecessary and insulting remarks about other people, I might have had some sympathy for the unsavoury press coverage he receives. Had I not believed in my heart that this was financially motivated, then I would have reacted differently. Had I not found the level of hypocrisy so distasteful, then I would have appraised this differently altogether. Had I not read Harry’s own words then I might never have been aware that this was in some part or largely driven out of revenge or jealousy, for his older brother and an accident of birth that he was born second. And finally, had Harry applied some level of objectivity then I might have respected some of what he was saying. For example the royal family have chosen a different approach to dealing with the press instead of Harry’s unwinnable war and his 20+ lawsuits. They want to rise above it and often ignore the stories written about them and advised Harry to do the same. Not only does he disagree with them, but he actually accuses them of planting the petty stories, he refers to in his book. Really - just sit back and think about it!!!Unfortunately one of my biggest issues with this book is its credibility. Is the book to explain the narrative? or is the narrative being written to suit and sell a book and his story now?. Had Harry come out at the beginning and stated his case or even hinted at the hurtful and damming accusations he is now making about his family. Had we been given a glimpse of this story he is now pedalling, (with the exception of the media) then the book might have felt more credible, his version more believable. Instead, it feels like it is only after his proposals to become a part time Royal were rejected that he has decided to be angry with his family so much so that he needs to tell the world about it. You would want out of this situation altogether if all this were true - not negotiate a different ‘Royal’ role that would allow you to pursue the celebrity lifestyle and fame that this couple appear to crave. I know what I think but it is up to you to draw your own conclusions.There was something to be said about the mystery and speculation surrounding the RF which allowed people like me to keep an open mind, because I thought there was more to it than what we were being told. Harry has dispelled any of those doubts. There is nothing of substance and no significant revelations that would go any way to justifying and explaining Harry’s betrayal of his family and their privacy.In summaryHarry claims to have secured his personal peace, but at what cost? The cost of betraying his family, army colleagues, friends, and the institution of the monarchy whilst at the same time compromising the privacy and potentially the security of others, including his family. Publishing his body count was immoral and insensitive to those impacted and his military colleagues. The way he has attacked William, feels disproportionate to anything William might have done and if there was something else then I’m sure Harry would have told us. So all of this has exacerbated an already strenuous relationship and makes any kind of reconciliation unlikely, but certainly more difficult. In my view, his gripe over being a ‘spare’ is disrespectful to the institution and the tax payers who support it, Many of us who have witnessed Harry's indulgent and privileged lifestyle over the years, when he was 3rd in line to the throne, will find this discourteous. Harry has had life handed to him on a silver plate, had the best of everything, and lived in some stunning homes. Yet he is that out of touch with the 'public mood' in the UK and so blinkered he would hope you would see him as a 'victim' and justified in ripping his family apart because he has had disagreements with his family, he was born second and had a smaller bedroom in Balmoral castle for example. Enough. Please, no more. Some readers will feel empathy for Harry’s statement that the RF will someday regret not being there for him during the second most difficult period of his life because they failed to defend him publicly. Yet they DO NOT defend themselves, their wives, and the wider family because it is their motto to ‘never complain, never explain’. Not some elaborate plan to oust a couple that could have offered so much. Not a case of treating couples differently as they would have you believe. Perhaps the RF need to reevaluate this motto they live by. Perhaps not because by in large it has prevented them from being embroiled in petty skirmishes with the media, that Harry himself seems intent on having when he’s not using them to support his book or to his own ends. Instead, they have risen above it and not challenged the stories, and if Harry really believes the RF would invest time in sharing stories with the press over lipgloss, a flower girls dress or whether a prince should wear a beard - then I fear for him. So, by publishing this bitter book that is heavily weighted against and critical of William, Harry has likely created the second most difficult time in Williams life and this course of action was deliberate and venomous. You are right, there will be regrets someday and it will be for writing this book. Hopefully you have now exhausted your bile. Now ‘spare’ us any more of this!!!And to remove any notions of bias, as a pro royalist. I am not a Royalist or in favour of keeping a large royal family. Some maybe because of the charity work they do and the causes they champion like William's 'Earthshot' programme, which is the stuff we really should be focused on. I also have issues with the lives of some of the RF but I am not here to comment on those. I am here to respond to Harry's book, his one-sided oxymoronic self indulgent story and his unverified allegations.So please ‘spare’ us anymore of this. Please enjoy your life in America. I sincerely wish you do something meaningful with your life, instead of swapping financial support from the RF with money gleaned from attacking the Royal Family. Having listened to Harry’s story, I have come out of this believing the real victims here are William and Kate. William who conducts himself so well publicly, but is restricted by protocol and Kate who has always remained dignified and classy. A wonderful ambassador for the RF. If only they could tell their side of the story. Yet Harry would have you believe Williams story is out there and this is Harry’s chance to tell his - what an insult to everything we have seen, witnessed and endured. Spare us please. Go live your life.And no more memoirs for me. I found this too challenging but I stand by my considered views that I deliberated over for a long time, although it has still pained me to express them, because Harry was once my favourite Royal.Show

Rating 5 out of 5,"I really enjoyed this on audio!! Over 15 hours in length, it's a big time commitment but listening to Harry share his story in his own words is totally worth it in my opinion!! Heartfelt and vulnerable, he shares stories from his childhood, about his mother, about life as a Royal, his military career and charitable work, meeting and falling in love with Meghan and their struggles being part of the Family and ultimately deciding to leave for their own safety and sanity. My respect for this couple is huge and I wish them nothing but the best! I'm sure he made a killing on this book deal but he has donated a significant amount to charities.

Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 ⭐⭐⭐ I listened to Prince Harry reading this on audible and I was surprised at how quickly I got through it (then again, I have the ability to listen to audiobooks at a ridiculous speed and still understand what's going on). As someone who is British and has been raised by a family that are very Royal Family orientated, it was kind of a no-brainer that I read this. I may not have been born when Princess Diana died, it is an event that to this day my family still talk about and feel; but no-one could feel as deeply as Prince Harry himself. Whilst I am not going to weigh in on the whole Harry and Meghan debate that everyone seems to be having, I will say that I understand why Harry and Meghan made the decision that they did. That being said, I think some of the things they did could have been done differently. That aside, this was actually an interesting book, but like many, I feel that there are probably a few details he could have spared us...Show more",3,35  I listened to Prince Harry reading this on audible and I was surprised at how quickly I got through it then again I have the ability to listen to audiobooks at a ridiculous speed and still understand whats going on As someone who is British and has been raised by a family that are very Royal Family orientated it was kind of a nobrainer that I read this I may not have been born when Princess Diana died it is an event that to this day my family still talk about and feel but noone could feel as deeply as Prince Harry himself Whilst I am not going to weigh in on the whole Harry and Meghan debate that everyone seems to be having I will say that I understand why Harry and Meghan made the decision that they did That being said I think some of the things they did could have been done differently That aside this was actually an interesting book but like many I feel that there are probably a few details he could have spared usShow more
Rating 3 out of 5,"My curiosity got the better of me and I read Prince Harry's memoir “Spare”. In the opening section he describes meeting with his father and William who state they don't know why he's done what he's done so he begins by saying “Pa, Willy, World... Here you go.” And I think the main point of his justification is stated later in the book when he says: “My problem has never been with the monarchy, or the concept of monarchy. It's been with the press and the sick relationship that's evolved between it and the Palace. I love my Mother Country, and I love my family, and I always will. I just wish, at the second-darkest moment of my life, they'd both been there for me. And I believe they'll look back one day and wish they had too.” Throughout the memoir he recounts the events of his entire life and states his case against the press and his family's failure to act on his and his wife's behalf. Most of us have probably seen some of the shocking revelations and statements that Harry and Meghan have made lately in interviews and through their documentary series. This couple have been everywhere! Many are aware of the horrific abuse they've received by some of the press and public, the bickering between Harry and his family leading up to a physical fight with William (which is detailed in the book), the testy relationship between Meghan and Kate – all of which lead Harry to officially break away from the Royal family. I think it's been well covered already how Harry openly talks in this book about his drinking and drug use, losing his virginity and what were probably his biggest public gaffs of wearing a nazi outfit to a fancy dress party and using a racial slur when talking about a friend because he “wasn't thinking” and because of a “failure of self education” which he humbly admits he needs to improve. However, there were several things I read in “Spare” which I found surprising and I discuss them in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdsfxXzWwIThere's no doubt Harry has undergone an extreme amount of physical and mental hardship and he's shown great resilience. He's clearly a talented and dedicated soldier (and it's a shame he wasn't able to continue in service because of risks to him and his colleagues). He's in some ways an ordinary guy who shops at TK Max, eats Nandos (bizarrely he places an order for this during the birth of his first child while sucking down laughing gas to help calm himself) and binge watches Friends – but he's also obviously in an extraordinarily privileged position. As one example, he labels himself a Chandler and later physically stays at Courtney Cox's house. So there's this odd mixture of the mundane with the extraordinary throughout the book which I guess is the thing that really makes us so fascinated by the Royals and what Harry calls his “fancy captivity”. I felt a limited amount of sympathy towards him after reading this book and I think it's effective in showing his point of view but I don't know if I'm convinced he's right and those he's speaking out against are wrong. Or that anyone in this situation can be completely right or wrong. Many claims are made about leaks from within the Royal House to the press and how the Queen's close aides were basically manipulating her before her death. However, most of this comes across as conjecture and paranoia with little evidence apart from his word - though it's not at all surprising Harry would be highly suspicious given all the backstabbing and dirty deals that apparently go on in these circles. How much should we trust his word? He states early in the memoir that he has an extraordinary memory for spaces but not dialogue from the past. There are many conversations recounted throughout the book in which he comes across as supremely reasonable while others sound irate. Should we trust that these were the things actually said? They might be roughly true but it feels like they mostly emphasise the fact that this is a one-sided account. Overall, I'm just left feeling the entire Royal mess is in a sad state of affairs. I'm not sure if this book will work positively towards fixing things or just fuel the fire which he seems so desperately to want to put out. But it makes sense that he'd put this book out there and it seems remarkable that we now have such a candid account from someone in the inner circle. I wouldn't recommend reading it unless you have a keen interest in the Royals and are really intrigued by such a personal account. However, if you do read it don't expect any clear answers.Show more",3,My curiosity got the better of me and I read Prince Harrys memoir Spare In the opening section he describes meeting with his father and William who state they dont know why hes done what hes done so he begins by saying Pa Willy World Here you go And I think the main point of his justification is stated later in the book when he says My problem has never been with the monarchy or the concept of monarchy Its been with the press and the sick relationship thats evolved between it and the Palace I love my Mother Country and I love my family and I always will I just wish at the seconddarkest moment of my life theyd both been there for me And I believe theyll look back one day and wish they had too Throughout the memoir he recounts the events of his entire life and states his case against the press and his familys failure to act on his and his wifes behalf Most of us have probably seen some of the shocking revelations and statements that Harry and Meghan have made lately in interviews and through their documentary series This couple have been everywhere Many are aware of the horrific abuse theyve received by some of the press and public the bickering between Harry and his family leading up to a physical fight with William which is detailed in the book the testy relationship between Meghan and Kate  all of which lead Harry to officially break away from the Royal family I think its been well covered already how Harry openly talks in this book about his drinking and drug use losing his virginity and what were probably his biggest public gaffs of wearing a nazi outfit to a fancy dress party and using a racial slur when talking about a friend because he wasnt thinking and because of a failure of self education which he humbly admits he needs to improve However there were several things I read in Spare which I found surprising and I discuss them in this video httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvoRdsfxXzWwITheres no doubt Harry has undergone an extreme amount of physical and mental hardship and hes shown great resilience Hes clearly a talented and dedicated soldier and its a shame he wasnt able to continue in service because of risks to him and his colleagues Hes in some ways an ordinary guy who shops at TK Max eats Nandos bizarrely he places an order for this during the birth of his first child while sucking down laughing gas to help calm himself and binge watches Friends  but hes also obviously in an extraordinarily privileged position As one example he labels himself a Chandler and later physically stays at Courtney Coxs house So theres this odd mixture of the mundane with the extraordinary throughout the book which I guess is the thing that really makes us so fascinated by the Royals and what Harry calls his fancy captivity I felt a limited amount of sympathy towards him after reading this book and I think its effective in showing his point of view but I dont know if Im convinced hes right and those hes speaking out against are wrong Or that anyone in this situation can be completely right or wrong Many claims are made about leaks from within the Royal House to the press and how the Queens close aides were basically manipulating her before her death However most of this comes across as conjecture and paranoia with little evidence apart from his word  though its not at all surprising Harry would be highly suspicious given all the backstabbing and dirty deals that apparently go on in these circles How much should we trust his word He states early in the memoir that he has an extraordinary memory for spaces but not dialogue from the past There are many conversations recounted throughout the book in which he comes across as supremely reasonable while others sound irate Should we trust that these were the things actually said They might be roughly true but it feels like they mostly emphasise the fact that this is a onesided account Overall Im just left feeling the entire Royal mess is in a sad state of affairs Im not sure if this book will work positively towards fixing things or just fuel the fire which he seems so desperately to want to put out But it makes sense that hed put this book out there and it seems remarkable that we now have such a candid account from someone in the inner circle I wouldnt recommend reading it unless you have a keen interest in the Royals and are really intrigued by such a personal account However if you do read it dont expect any clear answersShow more
Rating 3 out of 5,"So, I have always “liked” Harry. This memoir made me sad and sympathetic in parts, rather bored, but also somewhat interested; I did enjoy special moments about Diana, found an interesting new take on my original thoughts on King Charles, and confirmed my personal distaste for Camilla and Meghan. Unfortunately, I feel like he hypocritically is turning into the tabloid people he loathes and despises, turning family drama into a money source. In the end, he comes across like a grown man child throwing a tantrum and my eyes could not roll enough when she entered the picture. I am not condoning the paparazzi nonsense nor the rigid authority control of the monarchy, however if this is what you loathe, it is time to move on. Out of the limelight.

Rating 2 out of 5,"2.5 stars. Very long, very boring. How can a guy who's lived this life be so boring!?I listened to the author read the nearly 16 hour audiobook, and let's just say he's not a dynamic reader. Nor does he appear to have much sense of humor. Mostly, he just comes across as a really messed up kid. And, yes, there are very concrete reasons why this kid is messed up. But in the end, it's a little hard to feel sorry for him. There's just too much airing of dirty laundry, too much ""woe is me"" as he throws every member of his family under the bus. It's undignified. Time after time he exhibits extraordinarily poor judgement. Nazi costumes? Strip pool? Years of substance abuse (about which he's very candid, if that's what you want to read about). And he's so out of touch with reality.But, mostly, he just seems pretty dull.

Rating 2 out of 5,"I wanted to like this book.""Time, as the doctor said, would heal my todger. But would it heal my heart?""The language volleys between eloquent and juvenile. Referring to his penis multiple times (euphemistically), this book can at times be reminiscent of a love scene from 50 Shades of Grey (see: ""holy cow!"") in its immaturity, but then, immaturity radiates the majority of this book.Immense detail is given to several, seemingly unimportant events. The appearance of rooms, for example, are described wonderfully (much as Harry said they would be, given how his memory works). Quite unfortunately, this measured and careful writing does not extend to some of the more sensitive topics.Harry's military service is discussed, and at first reading, it might even appear thoroughly so. However, the majority of that writing feels less about service, his tours, and his fellow soldiers, and more about how these people have served him. You might fancy the point of a book like this is to do just that, but it has come across as horribly rushed and botched. The end result was insensitive, and portrayed both Harry and the military as nearly animalistic.Although, what else could be expected from a man who described his once almost father in law as an ""alpha"" in the very same book?Harry's former girlfriends (and, indeed, his wife) are given bland, two dimensional descriptions. All of them are described not by who they are or what they stand for, but by what they have offeres Harry. Yes, he does say they are smart or funny, but their entire personalities are boiled down to syrup.Even their suffering is written as a misfortune to Harry. The detail of what those women have lost, what cost they have paid, and their (potentially? the book is unclear) continued harassment is lost to the reader, as it simply has not been included beyond what serves the author.All in all, there is too much to write. This book is nothing special, nor is it terrible. It is simply dull.Harry is neither intelligent nor unintelligent. He would not be out of place at the local pub. He is, in all honesty, just Some Guy who happens to be royal, and sadly, it does not make him interesting. If anything, it makes what appears to be a shocking lack of outside-himself thinking to be all the worse.If this book had some direction or message, if it had focused more on service and personal experiences unique to a Royal, it would have been a riveting read. As it stands, it reads more like an ever-changing stream of consciousness and whatever message (beyond ""fuck the media"") it held has been lost. It is little better than Prince Andrew's infamous interview, given the continued air of superiority (something the subject himself likely does not realise) and the lack of tangible explanation.His family and the media are pretty shit, too.Show more",2,I wanted to like this bookTime as the doctor said would heal my todger But would it heal my heartThe language volleys between eloquent and juvenile Referring to his penis multiple times euphemistically this book can at times be reminiscent of a love scene from 50 Shades of Grey see holy cow in its immaturity but then immaturity radiates the majority of this bookImmense detail is given to several seemingly unimportant events The appearance of rooms for example are described wonderfully much as Harry said they would be given how his memory works Quite unfortunately this measured and careful writing does not extend to some of the more sensitive topicsHarrys military service is discussed and at first reading it might even appear thoroughly so However the majority of that writing feels less about service his tours and his fellow soldiers and more about how these people have served him You might fancy the point of a book like this is to do just that but it has come across as horribly rushed and botched The end result was insensitive and portrayed both Harry and the military as nearly animalisticAlthough what else could be expected from a man who described his once almost father in law as an alpha in the very same bookHarrys former girlfriends and indeed his wife are given bland two dimensional descriptions All of them are described not by who they are or what they stand for but by what they have offeres Harry Yes he does say they are smart or funny but their entire personalities are boiled down to syrupEven their suffering is written as a misfortune to Harry The detail of what those women have lost what cost they have paid and their potentially the book is unclear continued harassment is lost to the reader as it simply has not been included beyond what serves the authorAll in all there is too much to write This book is nothing special nor is it terrible It is simply dullHarry is neither intelligent nor unintelligent He would not be out of place at the local pub He is in all honesty just Some Guy who happens to be royal and sadly it does not make him interesting If anything it makes what appears to be a shocking lack of outsidehimself thinking to be all the worseIf this book had some direction or message if it had focused more on service and personal experiences unique to a Royal it would have been a riveting read As it stands it reads more like an everchanging stream of consciousness and whatever message beyond fuck the media it held has been lost It is little better than Prince Andrews infamous interview given the continued air of superiority something the subject himself likely does not realise and the lack of tangible explanationHis family and the media are pretty shit tooShow more
Rating 4 out of 5,"It’s hard to separate the writing of the memoir Spare and the choice of content, but the writing was intimate—at times funny, at times biting—and took the reader on an emotional journey. In every corner of Harry’s life is the shadow of his mother’s death and the grief that still hasn’t fully been processed. It is the very through-line of his story. That little boy behind the coffin is never far away from the reader’s mind. There are moments when your heart breaks for Harry, like when as boy, he was convinced his mother hadn’t been killed, but that it was a public hoax so that she could start her life over somewhere. Or, when as a young man, he felt the need to go repeatedly through the tunnel in Paris at the same speed that killed Princess Diana.There are moments of such sweetness in his memoir: his overwhelming love and respect for his grandpa, his final tender memories of his grandmother, his adoration of Africa, and his awe of being a father. Harry also takes us on a journey as he falls in love with Meghan. We feel his true excitement that he could finally have a person. There are also times when we learn more about his “todger” than we needed to know, though he points out that even the New York Times ran a piece speculating about his penis as a child (and whether he was circumcised). So, not even the privacy of his own body parts belonged to him. Still, it’s a bit much. But, the majority of the book covers his impressive public work and his military career, both aspects of his life endangered by being hounded by the press. It is a pattern in his life that those close to him have their lives threatened either by or because of paparazzi presence—once endangering a whole unit in Iran—meaning that few are willing to get too close or stay that way. It’s understandable that he would want to tell his story himself. Only, maybe we could do with less of his “todger.” Through the first third of the book, I felt that advanced leaks from the memoir were taken out of context and that his love of his father and brother shine through. By the end, it is clear that love is still there and strong, despite the gloves being off, but that Harry is choosing to protect his own family (his wife and children) in a way that he was never chosen and protected. (These warm fuzzies do *not* extend all the way to Camilla.)It’s apparent in this memoir that Prince Harry let down his walls and that he was willing to be vulnerable. He paints a very clear picture of why he had to step down from his role and move to protect his family and his own well-being, but the future of his relationship with his natal family is considerably murkier.Show more",4,Its hard to separate the writing of the memoir Spare and the choice of content but the writing was intimateat times funny at times bitingand took the reader on an emotional journey In every corner of Harrys life is the shadow of his mothers death and the grief that still hasnt fully been processed It is the very throughline of his story That little boy behind the coffin is never far away from the readers mind There are moments when your heart breaks for Harry like when as boy he was convinced his mother hadnt been killed but that it was a public hoax so that she could start her life over somewhere Or when as a young man he felt the need to go repeatedly through the tunnel in Paris at the same speed that killed Princess DianaThere are moments of such sweetness in his memoir his overwhelming love and respect for his grandpa his final tender memories of his grandmother his adoration of Africa and his awe of being a father Harry also takes us on a journey as he falls in love with Meghan We feel his true excitement that he could finally have a person There are also times when we learn more about his todger than we needed to know though he points out that even the New York Times ran a piece speculating about his penis as a child and whether he was circumcised So not even the privacy of his own body parts belonged to him Still its a bit much But the majority of the book covers his impressive public work and his military career both aspects of his life endangered by being hounded by the press It is a pattern in his life that those close to him have their lives threatened either by or because of paparazzi presenceonce endangering a whole unit in Iranmeaning that few are willing to get too close or stay that way Its understandable that he would want to tell his story himself Only maybe we could do with less of his todger Through the first third of the book I felt that advanced leaks from the memoir were taken out of context and that his love of his father and brother shine through By the end it is clear that love is still there and strong despite the gloves being off but that Harry is choosing to protect his own family his wife and children in a way that he was never chosen and protected These warm fuzzies do not extend all the way to CamillaIts apparent in this memoir that Prince Harry let down his walls and that he was willing to be vulnerable He paints a very clear picture of why he had to step down from his role and move to protect his family and his own wellbeing but the future of his relationship with his natal family is considerably murkierShow more
Rating 1 out of 5,"If this had been fiction, I might have given it 4 stars. It’s actually very well written, and it reads almost like a villain’s origin story, which is always interesting. But since this is a memoir, I got annoyed by how bratty Harry is throughout it. He complains about everything and uses his oh-so-tragic upbringing as excuse to be horrid. He keeps using “the spare” as a crutch, as though being “the spare” should entitle him to something because life had handed him such a bad fate. At one point he even complains that he’s only 3rd to the throne. If I didn’t hate him before, I would now. The amount of entitlement in this book is so vile that I could not stomach to finish it.

Rating 1 out of 5,"Royal family gossip is not really of any importance, so here are the parts of the book which actually matter (and I don't consider these spoilers because they have been all over the news):- Harry reveals he murdered 25 people in Afghanistan.- He compares murdering people to playing video games.- The victims ""were just chess pieces"" instead of actual people.Some have defended Harry by saying ""at least it's good that he owns up to it"" and ""he seems to have learned from it"".I, however, stronly disagree. Here are just a couple reasons why;- Harry implies he was ""only doing what he was told"". Not only is this a hideously bad excuse, it's also one that less privileged people wouldn't be allowed get away with.- He says the otherization of Muslims was part of military education. While without a doubt true, this is also another convenient way to downplay personal responsibility.- The rest of the book is basically Harry implying he's somehow now ""better"" than the rest of the cruel, racist, corrupt, criminal, bloodthirsty royal institution he used to be a part of (and in reality still is).What makes memoirs enjoyable is when the subject is truly willing to accept their own wrong-doings and take responsibility.Harry, clearly, is not.Nor will he ever face the consequences of his actions.Hence, this book shouldn't have been written at all.In its current state it's nothing but yet another slap in the face to those ""others"" to whom he, the Royals, the UK, and the rest of the Western war-criminals have caused immense pain and suffering with impunity.EDIT.Just to drive my point across, I'd like to share a particularly horrible section from the book:
These were bad people doing bad things to our guys. Doing bad things to the world.If this guy I’d just removed from the battlefield hadn’t already killed British soldiers, he soon would. Taking him meant saving British lives, sparing British families. Taking him meant fewer young men and women wrapped like mummies and shipped home on hospital beds, like the lads on my plane four years earlier, or the wounded men and women I’d visited at Selly Oak and other hospitals, or the brave team with whom I’d marched to the North Pole. And so my main thought that day, my only thought, was that I wished Control had got back to us sooner, had given us permission to fire more quickly, so we’d got the other seven.And yet, and yet.Much later, speaking about it with a mate, he asked: Did it factor into your feeling that these killers were on motorbikes? The chosen vehicle of paps all over the world?Could I honestly say that, while chasing a pack of motorbikes, not one particle of me was thinking about the pack of motorbikes that chased one Mercedes into a Paris tunnel? Or the packs of motorbikes that had chased me a thousand times? I couldn’t say.
Okay, a few comments on this:- It's 2023, and he is still trying to paint the invasion of Afghanistan as somehow moral and justified.- Notice how he uses the words ""take"" and ""remove"" instead of ""kill"" or ""murder"" when describing his own actions. Contrastingly, he has no problem referring to the people he shot as ""killers"".- Harry seeks compassion and understanding from everyone, but did he (or will he) show any to the people whose lives he destroyed? Of course not; they are, after all, just ""bad people"" doing ""bad things"".What a charming fellow.Show more",1,"Royal family gossip is not really of any importance so here are the parts of the book which actually matter and I dont consider these spoilers because they have been all over the news Harry reveals he murdered 25 people in Afghanistan He compares murdering people to playing video games The victims were just chess pieces instead of actual peopleSome have defended Harry by saying at least its good that he owns up to it and he seems to have learned from itI however stronly disagree Here are just a couple reasons why Harry implies he was only doing what he was told Not only is this a hideously bad excuse its also one that less privileged people wouldnt be allowed get away with He says the otherization of Muslims was part of military education While without a doubt true this is also another convenient way to downplay personal responsibility The rest of the book is basically Harry implying hes somehow now better than the rest of the cruel racist corrupt criminal bloodthirsty royal institution he used to be a part of and in reality still isWhat makes memoirs enjoyable is when the subject is truly willing to accept their own wrongdoings and take responsibilityHarry clearly is notNor will he ever face the consequences of his actionsHence this book shouldnt have been written at allIn its current state its nothing but yet another slap in the face to those others to whom he the Royals the UK and the rest of the Western warcriminals have caused immense pain and suffering with impunityEDITJust to drive my point across Id like to share a particularly horrible section from the book

Rating 5 out of 5,"Edit/Update (1/12/2023)After processing with a couple of friends this week, I wanted to add a few things.The familial dysfunction that Harry writes about is something many can relate to. And, often it takes self-work and therapy to improve how you show up in relationships and the boundaries you are able to set as a result.Harry’s experience as a young child/person show the struggles he had with sharing his feelings and that as he matured and started that self-work, he was able to change how he showed up in relationships, how he showed up in his work. I saw a recent headline that was something to the effect of “Harry caught in cult of psychotherapy.” Harry obviously believes in therapy, believe in improving oneself and learning (as I believe there is evidence of), and if other members of their families do not or do on a surface level, then it is easy to see/understand how the rifts have continued to grow.While many of Harry’s experiences are obviously unique, what strikes me about Harry and his writing is how relatable he is. Of course I’m not royal, I haven’t had a significant loss, I haven’t served in the military. I have experienced toxic and challenging relationships, I have experienced feeling misunderstood, invalidated, and unheard. In one of his interviews Harry expressed that one of his goals in sharing some of the details he shared was to remind people that “you are not alone.” Talking about all of this helps reduce stigma on so many levels.There are some funny slightly awkward stories he included that made me laugh and I loved that because we see that playful nerdy side of Harry in his interviews as well.There will always be critics but I enjoyed reading Spare.Original review (1/11/2023): I felt as though I was reading a long letter from a friend. Harry shares his life, experiences, thoughts and feelings openly and compassionately. He tells it like it is—doesn’t sugarcoat and yet consistently expresses his wish for things to be different than they are. He calls out familial poor behavior as kindly and compassionately as possible while being firm and extending more grace than what is likely deserved.British media are ruthless, cunning, and incredibly heartless, focused on headlines and money. No one could or should have to live with the frequent almost daily vitriol that is spewed at and about him, Meghan, and their family. This is a very well-written book and I hope others will have more understanding and compassion for him and Meghan after reading—I wish them peace and happiness.Show more",5,EditUpdate 1122023After processing with a couple of friends this week I wanted to add a few thingsThe familial dysfunction that Harry writes about is something many can relate to And often it takes selfwork and therapy to improve how you show up in relationships and the boundaries you are able to set as a resultHarrys experience as a young childperson show the struggles he had with sharing his feelings and that as he matured and started that selfwork he was able to change how he showed up in relationships how he showed up in his work I saw a recent headline that was something to the effect of Harry caught in cult of psychotherapy Harry obviously believes in therapy believe in improving oneself and learning as I believe there is evidence of and if other members of their families do not or do on a surface level then it is easy to seeunderstand how the rifts have continued to growWhile many of Harrys experiences are obviously unique what strikes me about Harry and his writing is how relatable he is Of course Im not royal I havent had a significant loss I havent served in the military I have experienced toxic and challenging relationships I have experienced feeling misunderstood invalidated and unheard In one of his interviews Harry expressed that one of his goals in sharing some of the details he shared was to remind people that you are not alone Talking about all of this helps reduce stigma on so many levelsThere are some funny slightly awkward stories he included that made me laugh and I loved that because we see that playful nerdy side of Harry in his interviews as wellThere will always be critics but I enjoyed reading SpareOriginal review 1112023 I felt as though I was reading a long letter from a friend Harry shares his life experiences thoughts and feelings openly and compassionately He tells it like it isdoesnt sugarcoat and yet consistently expresses his wish for things to be different than they are He calls out familial poor behavior as kindly and compassionately as possible while being firm and extending more grace than what is likely deservedBritish media are ruthless cunning and incredibly heartless focused on headlines and money No one could or should have to live with the frequent almost daily vitriol that is spewed at and about him Meghan and their family This is a very wellwritten book and I hope others will have more understanding and compassion for him and Meghan after readingI wish them peace and happinessShow more
Rating 5 out of 5,"I went into this book with an open mind. I am not particularly invested in the British monarchy, but it's been pretty hard to exist over the past few years and not be aware of the way Harry and Meghan have made headlines around the world - the effects of which have been polarising.In choosing the format in which to consume this book, I decided on the audiobook because I wanted to hear Harry tell his own story. And honestly, I enjoyed every second of his telling of it. Not because it was particularly juicy or salacious, but I felt there was a genuine openness and honesty about him sharing some of the intimate details of his childhood, his life, and family dynamics that were, at times, incredibly sad and heartbreaking. The actual content of the book wasn't even about ""spilling tea"" - yes, he shared some personal moments that I felt provided a lot of clarity and context, but nothing that I thought was necessarily disrespectful to anyone. Enlightening, certainly, but not ill-intentioned. At least I didn't think so. He also didn't shy away from addressing his own mistakes and errors in judgement. He speaks about them frankly and his remorse felt genuine.I'm not here to make the case that Harry is not a privileged man, or that he hasn't had the world at his feet from the moment he was born. That's obvious. But to be fair to Harry, he's not making that argument either. However, having privilege doesn't make someone unworthy of empathy. What Harry is saying is that there are loads of lies about him and his wife that have been smeared across tabloids for years - some instigated by his own family - and instead of remaining silent and allowing others to dictate his narrative, he wants to tell his own story, from his perspective. The idea that he should just turn a blind eye to falsehoods that are constantly circulated about him for clicks is absurd - would any of us continue to remain loyal to an institution that continuously lies about who we are and remains silent when unfair attacks and vicious racist rhetoric is bandied about for sport? I think not.And honestly, I'm not interested in listening to the opinions of 1 star reviewers who read an excerpt out of context and now think they're qualified to share their misinformed opinions. Or people who out of spite rated a book poorly purely because they hate someone for merely breathing. To those people, check your priorities. No one has to like Harry or Meghan, nor does everyone have to agree with the decisions they've made. But the levels of hate directed at them for simply wanting to set the record straight is mind boggling to me. They have the right to share what their experiences have been like, and after 5.5 hours of listening, I can confidently say, I get it.Show more",5,I went into this book with an open mind I am not particularly invested in the British monarchy but its been pretty hard to exist over the past few years and not be aware of the way Harry and Meghan have made headlines around the world  the effects of which have been polarisingIn choosing the format in which to consume this book I decided on the audiobook because I wanted to hear Harry tell his own story And honestly I enjoyed every second of his telling of it Not because it was particularly juicy or salacious but I felt there was a genuine openness and honesty about him sharing some of the intimate details of his childhood his life and family dynamics that were at times incredibly sad and heartbreaking The actual content of the book wasnt even about spilling tea  yes he shared some personal moments that I felt provided a lot of clarity and context but nothing that I thought was necessarily disrespectful to anyone Enlightening certainly but not illintentioned At least I didnt think so He also didnt shy away from addressing his own mistakes and errors in judgement He speaks about them frankly and his remorse felt genuineIm not here to make the case that Harry is not a privileged man or that he hasnt had the world at his feet from the moment he was born Thats obvious But to be fair to Harry hes not making that argument either However having privilege doesnt make someone unworthy of empathy What Harry is saying is that there are loads of lies about him and his wife that have been smeared across tabloids for years  some instigated by his own family  and instead of remaining silent and allowing others to dictate his narrative he wants to tell his own story from his perspective The idea that he should just turn a blind eye to falsehoods that are constantly circulated about him for clicks is absurd  would any of us continue to remain loyal to an institution that continuously lies about who we are and remains silent when unfair attacks and vicious racist rhetoric is bandied about for sport I think notAnd honestly Im not interested in listening to the opinions of 1 star reviewers who read an excerpt out of context and now think theyre qualified to share their misinformed opinions Or people who out of spite rated a book poorly purely because they hate someone for merely breathing To those people check your priorities No one has to like Harry or Meghan nor does everyone have to agree with the decisions theyve made But the levels of hate directed at them for simply wanting to set the record straight is mind boggling to me They have the right to share what their experiences have been like and after 55 hours of listening I can confidently say I get itShow more

Rating 5 out of 5,"Trauma..it is the major theme that affects Harry - long past childhood, it ensnares him even as an adult. What can i say but this book is exceptionally well written...while I was reading I could feel Prince Harry pouring every emotion and you feel as though your there with him on every personal and private journey because he gives such detailed and clear descriptions.This book needed to be written to set it straight what is in Harry's mind. Remember the media hounded Diana and eventually had a part in her death by driving her like an animal they were in hunt for.he gives examples of what the British media has said about him and his family as well. His hatred of the British media and paps are well justified.

Rating 5 out of 5,"Whew, there's a lot in this memoir. It was divided into 3 parts: childhood, soldiering & Meghan.I believe utterly that this is Harry's view of what happened. I believe just as fully both his brother & father would have many corrections to this narrative. I think we do hear from the family in the press, especially his Dad (Pa) & Camilla, indirectly, which is cowardly.I believe 100% that William made the comment about the color of Archie's skin, though the memoir never addresses it.One of the largest surprises was that William and Harry basically have had a nonexistent relationship since before Diana died.Long before Will met Kate and Harry met Meghan. Their fractured relationship really has nothing to do with either wife.The 2nd largest surprise was the sheer level of animosity William appears to have harbored for Harry, which is suggested to have begun in their childhood. Maybe sibling rivalry exacerbated by trauma? It comes off as incredibly petty given how much more money and power William has.William is an incredible bully. He never ever defends Harry but does call on him for help when he's being bullied by mutual friends of theirs.Harry longs for a deeper connection to his big brother, but Will honestly wants nothing to do with him. Their relationship is so distant that Harry & Will go on tour or engagement in Lesotho together after Will has become engaged privately to Kate. Will never even mentioned it to Harry. Harry finds out when it's published in the papers with the rest of the world.Also the family is so fucking cold that Harry's never hugged his own grandparents. It's implied he's never hugged his father's siblings either. Like you could melt ice on the asses of these cold hearted folks.I don't even understand this kinda relationship. Bizarre and unhealthy.That weird story in the press about Harry inheriting his mom's engagement ring and Wills having to ask for it to pop the question to Kate are all lies. The brothers also weren't each others best men at their respective weddings, just more lies for the press.I was surprised that Meghan's TV show had to have her scenes and dialogue approved by the palace before filming.Meghan was a fiance, not a wife, and already, her entire life was pretty much dictated by royal advisors at a palace she didn't even receive support from.Both Harry and the late Queen seemed surprised that Harry needed permission to marry Meghan. This felt odd to me as I fucking know this. How do actual family members not? The Queen didn't know which family members needed her permission to marry? Charles III does indeed suggest that he has no money to support Meghan after years of speaking about a 'slimmed down monarchy including his son's and their families'. This is shortly after setting up a trustfund for his Stepkids, Camilla’s children from her first marriage. The leaking between the palaces was harrowing. The Queen leaks against her family. Charles leaks against his sons. William leaks against Harry. Harry goes public with private family knowledge in puzzling and unnecessary detail.This entire family is a fucking mess.Harry is relatable with all his cannabis consumption, psychedlic and recreational drug use, drinking etc. He even used a tank of laughing gas when Meghan was in labor with Archie which I felt was a bit unacceptable. He talks about his penis, the todger, more than I'd like.Camilla suggested to Meg that Harry become the Governor General of Bermuda as they're having trouble with press when their relationship first goes public. This is before they're even engaged. So, the plan was always for them to scuttle off out of the limelight.Meg and Charles seem to get along well. Wills is put off Meg hugged him and didn't bow. Kate is unbalanced by Meg's Americanness. It's mostly manufactured nonsense.The ludicrous disagreements between Kate & Meghan are very high school mean girl- esque. I don't understand why Kate can't speak up if she's upset about the hormone cooment? It's weird on multiple levels to call a meeting and demand an apology months later. Just weird.Wills gets confrontational with Meghan and she tells him politely to get his finger out of her face; suddenly Will hates Meg.Wills struggles to control his temper in much of this narrative. He's petty, mean, bullying and fragile as spun glass. The so-called 'Sandringham Summitt' was a joke. Before the meeting started the Queen's office had already drafted a press release saying Harry & Meghan were leaving.So the 5 options offered were never real options. Harry was effectively kicked out of the family.He was promised security and continued financial support for a year.It turns out that too was a lie.Security was removed suddenly and without advance warning.His own father wouldn't even take his calls regarding this.Then they moved to Tyler Perry's house but quickly needed to get their own set up and right then Charles cuts off financial help.It's clear the family was trying to bully them back to the palace.See, removing security is what got Diana killed, no two ways about it. Her security detail would've never allowed what happened to her to happen.Charles knew that and William knew that. Not to mention his own Grandmother, the Queen.I'm shocked they gave so few fucks.Like whoa.Harry & Meghan's threat level was equal to the Queens. Higher than any other member of the family and still his own father didn't fight his loss of security or pay to replace it.The base toxicity in misusing power so oppressively. Then the epic level gaslighting to back it up.Shit with family like this, who needs enemies? I see why the couple is doing TV shows and writing books. Their security costs are outrageous, Harry has no marketable skills and little education. Meghan was basically a cable actress and only on 1 show at that.I would assume Meghan could get tons of work, but Harry is uncomfortable with her romantic scenes. I also think it is a class issue with their current titles and roles.So they sell access to their experiences, and honestly, I'm not mad at them. I think they are desperately trying to secure enough resources to raise their kids safely. They are also continuing philanthropic work which isn't as helpful as most think but can be noble I guess. Philanthropy is largely a tax haven but I digress.At the same time, even after comparing his family to a death cult, Harry doesn't denounce monarchy. He gives a couple 'lip service' passages to the evils of colonialism, but overall, he's a proud Brit and a monarchist.I didn't expect anything less, and that's truthfully why I pirated this book. The Royals are OG colonists. I'm never willingly giving them money.I wish Harry & Meghan and their little family the best. Meghan's the best thing that ever happened to Harry. They're a great couple and a happy family.They would've been a huge asset to Charles III and I do think in time their experiences will have a detrimental impact on the monarchy as an institution. The racism is obvious and epic. It will continue to echo through The Commonwealth. Ah may it all end soon:)I'd give this a 3.75 probably rounded to a 4 but given the racists have been bombing the reviews I feel.honor bound to counteract that with a 5 star rating.Show more",5,Whew

Rating 3 out of 5,"This was a disappointing read that left me feeling decidedly worse about the toxicity of the royal family and bleak about any hopes of improvement. It might be worth a read for someone interested in the 'drama' of the royals, but anyone hoping for a decent piece of writing should look elsewhere. In the final chapters Harry does have some decent reflections on the absence of choice for this ‘unending Truman show’. It seems to me that ‘Spare’ is a very unaware rant about the hardships of life in the spotlight. These complaints are entirely valid, things like wanting security for personal protection seems eminently reasonable, until one is told of the insistence to not use inheritance from Dianne as it’s seen as rightfully ‘his children’s’ blunts some of my sympathy. The children of the rich and famous don’t strike me as especially needy… This is where the book falls short – what he and his family faces is truly monstrous, something I would wish on no one. But many of us face hardship, and we do not have a ‘Tyler Perry’ billionaire we can call to rescue us, free of charge. I appreciate this is not his fault, but he remains pretty tone deaf to this privilege. By his early 20s his lack of awareness that a Nazi uniform might be offensive, or that ‘Paki’ was a racist term, seem curious to me. He is very apologetic for this mistakes and I do not think one should be barred from growth. He argues it is our personal responsibility to educate ourselves – to look more outwardly and understand discrimination. True, but it seems to me that he does not reflect on why he did not know this. Was it the moulding of the palace? Or the locker-school-boy environment of Eton? He needs to take more ownership of these and imply less universality. Reflecting on a nice Ernest Henley poem he writes that ‘Every Brit knew that poem. Many had the first line by heart’ and then ‘what schoolboy or schoolgirl didn’t encounter at least once those sonorous final lines?’ The answer is simple, one that did not go through a privileged educational system. Despite this missed opportunity to reflect, my main issue with the book is one of length and overarching message. It’s ghost-written very well, in such a way that style or flair is sacrificed for ease of consumption. The best autobiographies shape narratives and themes across their pages. This seems more like a rambling letter of hate, a spirited censure of scorn. Harry Windsor has evidently been plagued by the press and deeply mistreated by his family. This book, if nothing else, should be a call for the British public to reflect on the lunatic state of the monarchy, the press that ensnares them, and our own interest that feeds this frenzy. Halving the length of the book and concentrating on some key themes, perhaps even media frenzy, might have made for a better piece of writing or work. He might have chosen excerpts of his life to recount of this frenzy and found ways of narratively tying them together. Thinking about other autobiographies I’ve enjoyed, Michelle Obama’s central theme of ‘swerving’ seems both robust and easy for the reader to take with them. Beyond this, it is the story of a man born with a silver spoon who might well have preferred a rusty fork. In the closing chapters he reminds the reader that he did not opt into this life, and that it has its own measures of hardship. I know I certainly would not want it, so why do we keep it? Why not shrink the monarchy and reform the press? Stop clicking the links, following the headlines, and let our obsession with this family die. So long as there’s some lingering interest, the media will continue to torment.Show more",3,This was a disappointing read that left me feeling decidedly worse about the toxicity of the royal family and bleak about any hopes of improvement It might be worth a read for someone interested in the drama of the royals but anyone hoping for a decent piece of writing should look elsewhere In the final chapters Harry does have some decent reflections on the absence of choice for this unending Truman show It seems to me that Spare is a very unaware rant about the hardships of life in the spotlight These complaints are entirely valid things like wanting security for personal protection seems eminently reasonable until one is told of the insistence to not use inheritance from Dianne as its seen as rightfully his childrens blunts some of my sympathy The children of the rich and famous dont strike me as especially needy This is where the book falls short  what he and his family faces is truly monstrous something I would wish on no one But many of us face hardship and we do not have a Tyler Perry billionaire we can call to rescue us free of charge I appreciate this is not his fault but he remains pretty tone deaf to this privilege By his early 20s his lack of awareness that a Nazi uniform might be offensive or that Paki was a racist term seem curious to me He is very apologetic for this mistakes and I do not think one should be barred from growth He argues it is our personal responsibility to educate ourselves  to look more outwardly and understand discrimination True but it seems to me that he does not reflect on why he did not know this Was it the moulding of the palace Or the lockerschoolboy environment of Eton He needs to take more ownership of these and imply less universality Reflecting on a nice Ernest Henley poem he writes that Every Brit knew that poem Many had the first line by heart and then what schoolboy or schoolgirl didnt encounter at least once those sonorous final lines The answer is simple one that did not go through a privileged educational system Despite this missed opportunity to reflect my main issue with the book is one of length and overarching message Its ghostwritten very well in such a way that style or flair is sacrificed for ease of consumption The best autobiographies shape narratives and themes across their pages This seems more like a rambling letter of hate a spirited censure of scorn Harry Windsor has evidently been plagued by the press and deeply mistreated by his family This book if nothing else should be a call for the British public to reflect on the lunatic state of the monarchy the press that ensnares them and our own interest that feeds this frenzy Halving the length of the book and concentrating on some key themes perhaps even media frenzy might have made for a better piece of writing or work He might have chosen excerpts of his life to recount of this frenzy and found ways of narratively tying them together Thinking about other autobiographies Ive enjoyed Michelle Obamas central theme of swerving seems both robust and easy for the reader to take with them Beyond this it is the story of a man born with a silver spoon who might well have preferred a rusty fork In the closing chapters he reminds the reader that he did not opt into this life and that it has its own measures of hardship I know I certainly would not want it so why do we keep it Why not shrink the monarchy and reform the press Stop clicking the links following the headlines and let our obsession with this family die So long as theres some lingering interest the media will continue to tormentShow more
Rating 1 out of 5,"I can't abide people who think they're blameless. This whole book is all 'poor Harry'. He doesn't blame himself for anything. He's been spoilt as a child and spoilt as an adult. Moaning when Charles cut him off and wondering how they would manage yet he still lives in a big house. Oh poor, poor Harry.As everyone knows Harry lost his mother when he was young. Yet so did his brother William. It is quite clear throughout Harry's storytelling that William cares about him a great deal and is worried about him and wanting to get him help. William can obviously see he is going the same way as his mother did (paranoid).The book does not have a male voice. It reads like a woman wrote it. Very flowery prose that had me laughing out loud a lot but mostly cringing! Harry is clearly besotted with Meghan but he thinks everyone else should be too so woe betide anyone who isn't...namely the British press, William & Kate. At first Charles loved Meghan but when he found out she was giving up her job and he'd have to pay for her it seems in Harry's eyes he went off her! The Queen loved Meghan instantly and it was even she who suggested Meghan write the famous letter to her father! The British press left Meghan sobbing and suicidal (she's always sobbing). Harry stated 'I'll get you help but first I need to go to this function this evening but you stay here'. 'No' cried Meghan 'I'll go with you'. There is then no further mention of her suicidal tendencies or no mention of getting her help. Harry himself though has a Therapist and turns to her a lot. At the end of the book he thanks a whole host of Therapists, so not sure why he didn't get one of them to help Meghan?! There is a distinct lack of Meghan's opinions throughout the book, so I can only assume she's writing one next and we'll get her side of the boring story. I can hardly wait..(rolls eyes).It left me feeling very sorry for William and Kate. Harry has a lot of digs at them both. I expect they had to just wash their hands of him in the end as William tried that many times to help him but Harry's sees it a different way. It was clear to me as the reader that William was very worried about him.Harry admits to taking drugs and still smokes weed. I think it's addled his brain. He clearly can't remember things correctly. He writes of the Queen as if she was on his side and states they had a secret special relationship (rolls eyes). Even after the Queen died he believes she appeared as a Hummingbird in his home in America! He's clearly away with the fairies! Hopefully he has his happy life in America (making money out of his fairy stories) and stays away from the UK for good.Show more",1,I cant abide people who think theyre blameless This whole book is all poor Harry He doesnt blame himself for anything Hes been spoilt as a child and spoilt as an adult Moaning when Charles cut him off and wondering how they would manage yet he still lives in a big house Oh poor poor HarryAs everyone knows Harry lost his mother when he was young Yet so did his brother William It is quite clear throughout Harrys storytelling that William cares about him a great deal and is worried about him and wanting to get him help William can obviously see he is going the same way as his mother did paranoidThe book does not have a male voice It reads like a woman wrote it Very flowery prose that had me laughing out loud a lot but mostly cringing Harry is clearly besotted with Meghan but he thinks everyone else should be too so woe betide anyone who isntnamely the British press William  Kate At first Charles loved Meghan but when he found out she was giving up her job and hed have to pay for her it seems in Harrys eyes he went off her The Queen loved Meghan instantly and it was even she who suggested Meghan write the famous letter to her father The British press left Meghan sobbing and suicidal shes always sobbing Harry stated Ill get you help but first I need to go to this function this evening but you stay here No cried Meghan Ill go with you There is then no further mention of her suicidal tendencies or no mention of getting her help Harry himself though has a Therapist and turns to her a lot At the end of the book he thanks a whole host of Therapists so not sure why he didnt get one of them to help Meghan There is a distinct lack of Meghans opinions throughout the book so I can only assume shes writing one next and well get her side of the boring story I can hardly waitrolls eyesIt left me feeling very sorry for William and Kate Harry has a lot of digs at them both I expect they had to just wash their hands of him in the end as William tried that many times to help him but Harrys sees it a different way It was clear to me as the reader that William was very worried about himHarry admits to taking drugs and still smokes weed I think its addled his brain He clearly cant remember things correctly He writes of the Queen as if she was on his side and states they had a secret special relationship rolls eyes Even after the Queen died he believes she appeared as a Hummingbird in his home in America Hes clearly away with the fairies Hopefully he has his happy life in America making money out of his fairy stories and stays away from the UK for goodShow more

Rating 2 out of 5,"I have thoughts...To start, this book is readable, though wordy, and Harry shares a great deal of his personal life. The first section held my attention most, where he describes his childhood and then the loss of his mother. Very moving, and I teared up a few times. The rest of the book is a bit wandering, covering his time in the military and his eventual relationship with Meghan. The main issue I have that led me to give a 2 star rating is this.

Rating 4 out of 5,"Putting my own personal thoughts on the monarchy aside, (and the fact that I'm nosy), Prince Harry's ""controversial"" and ""highly anticipated"" memoir, Spare, portrays himself as a person, who is breaking generational trauma and a toxic family dynamic (because they should ""never complain, never explain"").As a lover of history, none of what Harry describes shocked me, because he grew up in an institution that has - historically - been racist, oppressive and imperialist. Centuries worth of history is really shining through in twenty-first century Britain. Spare bared the similarities to the famous Burn Book from Mean Girls, because the amount of names and gossip that Harry exposes... It is quite unbelievable how much of this great gossip comes from ugly and uncovered truths. Throughout Spare, loss and trauma play a dominant role. His poignant memories of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, and finding that ""mummy’s been in a car crash... They tried, darling boy. I’m afraid she didn’t make it"", were completely heartbreaking to read, particularly because I am someone who never got to experience the life of Diana when she was alive. The paparazzi slander in relation to Diana was intense, it is only right to feel anger when public figures are horrifically violated against having their own privacy. When Harry particularly writes that ""they can’t break me, I thought. Is it, I wondered, because I’m already broken?"", this highlighted the greater impact of the paparazzi on his mental health as a child.Unfortunately, Harry doesn’t write very well, which made the memoir feel poorly executed and ill thought - if anything, there were certain details that, I felt, caused more damage than good, as it gave a glimpse of Harry's taste for drama.For me, his memories of Diana were undermined by petty point-scoring in William and Harry's sibling rivalry. In several startling confessions of their physical rifts, it proved that this picture perfect family was crumbling behind the scenes. But as ""Willy and I would turn on each other"", I couldn't stop thinking about how William was constantly being presented as the arch nemesis, whilst Harry is the victim. Even when Harry discusses his brother's appearance in the prologue - the ""alarming baldness... His famous resemblance to Mummy, which was fading with time"" - it felt quite childish and petty, given that Harry mentioned in his recent interview with Tom Bradby that he hoped for reconciliation (not sure that will happen now though, Harry). He spared (haha sorry) us no details on his very intimate moments - from losing his virginity, to having a frostbitten penis, even doing mushrooms at Courteney Cox's house - all of which were... Odd to read, but I suppose since Harry had been silenced for so long, everything had to be spewed out. Harry admits that he killed 25 Taliban members during his time as a soldier in Afghanistan, which can be seen as victorious for some, however, this can be hugely damaging, not only to the Royal Family, but to veterans and current soldiers.There will always be controversy over his decision to publish this memoir. When reading, a part of me felt like he needed more intense therapy sessions, rather than spilling all his trauma onto a 400+ page book, but another part of me cannot help but think how liberating this was for Harry. With every page turned in Spare, you cannot help but feel as though your heart breaks for him. I am glad he got to tell his story (as a memoir, but I think he released far too many podcasts, Netflix documentaries and interviews that pretty much say the same stuff), regardless, I still highly recommend.Show more",4,Putting my own personal thoughts on the monarchy aside and the fact that Im nosy Prince Harrys controversial and highly anticipated memoir Spare portrays himself as a person who is breaking generational trauma and a toxic family dynamic because they should never complain never explainAs a lover of history none of what Harry describes shocked me because he grew up in an institution that has  historically  been racist oppressive and imperialist Centuries worth of history is really shining through in twentyfirst century Britain Spare bared the similarities to the famous Burn Book from Mean Girls because the amount of names and gossip that Harry exposes It is quite unbelievable how much of this great gossip comes from ugly and uncovered truths Throughout Spare loss and trauma play a dominant role His poignant memories of his mother Diana Princess of Wales and finding that mummys been in a car crash They tried darling boy Im afraid she didnt make it were completely heartbreaking to read particularly because I am someone who never got to experience the life of Diana when she was alive The paparazzi slander in relation to Diana was intense it is only right to feel anger when public figures are horrifically violated against having their own privacy When Harry particularly writes that they cant break me I thought Is it I wondered because Im already broken this highlighted the greater impact of the paparazzi on his mental health as a childUnfortunately Harry doesnt write very well which made the memoir feel poorly executed and ill thought  if anything there were certain details that I felt caused more damage than good as it gave a glimpse of Harrys taste for dramaFor me his memories of Diana were undermined by petty pointscoring in William and Harrys sibling rivalry In several startling confessions of their physical rifts it proved that this picture perfect family was crumbling behind the scenes But as Willy and I would turn on each other I couldnt stop thinking about how William was constantly being presented as the arch nemesis whilst Harry is the victim Even when Harry discusses his brothers appearance in the prologue  the alarming baldness His famous resemblance to Mummy which was fading with time  it felt quite childish and petty given that Harry mentioned in his recent interview with Tom Bradby that he hoped for reconciliation not sure that will happen now though Harry He spared haha sorry us no details on his very intimate moments  from losing his virginity to having a frostbitten penis even doing mushrooms at Courteney Coxs house  all of which were Odd to read but I suppose since Harry had been silenced for so long everything had to be spewed out Harry admits that he killed 25 Taliban members during his time as a soldier in Afghanistan which can be seen as victorious for some however this can be hugely damaging not only to the Royal Family but to veterans and current soldiersThere will always be controversy over his decision to publish this memoir When reading a part of me felt like he needed more intense therapy sessions rather than spilling all his trauma onto a 400 page book but another part of me cannot help but think how liberating this was for Harry With every page turned in Spare you cannot help but feel as though your heart breaks for him I am glad he got to tell his story as a memoir but I think he released far too many podcasts Netflix documentaries and interviews that pretty much say the same stuff regardless I still highly recommendShow more

Rating 5 out of 5,"I can't understand why so many are hating on this book. I found it fascinating. If for nothing else, it gives first person insight into an insular (and quite drafty) institution. I found Prince Harry to be quite caring and insightful. Yes, I realize it's his story told by him via professionals who are hired to portray him in the best light. But, who can possibly imagine a lifetime under such scrutiny. He was born into a life he didn't ask for, doesn't want, and a life he can never truly escape. The little insights were truly interesting and just written as if everyone is bathed by other people, we all walk by our father's room as he's being dressed by his valet, or bagpipes are played at the request of our grandmother. Such a different life!I think living away from the royal life will be healthy. His smile seems more genuine in the interviews promoting the book than when he was forced before ""the wall"". I do hope they scale back more and more and live a more common life. Photo opportunities where an entire village come out to dance and perform for them is one thing.

Rating 4 out of 5,"After reading this book, I feel like I know Prince Harry inside and out from some of his deep inner thoughts and his perspectives on life.There are three parts of the book. It starts with his childhood growing up in private schools and then feeling the pain and shock when “Mummy” died. It took years before he could accept that she was actually killed in an accident. The second part is about how proud he was to be an important part of the British Army. He finally felt like he was able to contribute toward helping his country and soldiers.And finally, the last 100 or so pages are about his love for Meghan Markle. I don’t know why he included her last name as everyone knows who she is. Throughout the pages, he includes thoughts on grief, racism and psychological pressures of being stalked by the press. He shares his relationship with his grandmother, the Queen, his father, now the King, his brother Willy and his Aunt Margaret. He said she was also a “spare.” “Even my father reminds me that unfortunately Willy and I can’t be normal…in which normal events were treated as abnormal, and the abnormal was routinely normalized.”Every reader will have an opinion about Harry and the Royals after reading this book. The Press was constantly following him as lazy, a drug addict, single with no prospects and actually comparing him to Bridget Jones…really? They talked about his ratty shoes and mismatched outfits. Later, his girlfriends were followed by the press and then there was his life with Meghan when he was finally happy. He was told that it will be difficult for her. Yet, the press wanted him to be married. Most of us know he ended up leaving his beloved country to find a better life.To live without freedom from the press made him want to expose every secret so there could be nothing left except a man with his wife and children wanting peace.Show more",4,After reading this book I feel like I know Prince Harry inside and out from some of his deep inner thoughts and his perspectives on lifeThere are three parts of the book It starts with his childhood growing up in private schools and then feeling the pain and shock when Mummy died It took years before he could accept that she was actually killed in an accident The second part is about how proud he was to be an important part of the British Army He finally felt like he was able to contribute toward helping his country and soldiersAnd finally the last 100 or so pages are about his love for Meghan Markle I dont know why he included her last name as everyone knows who she is Throughout the pages he includes thoughts on grief racism and psychological pressures of being stalked by the press He shares his relationship with his grandmother the Queen his father now the King his brother Willy and his Aunt Margaret He said she was also a spare Even my father reminds me that unfortunately Willy and I cant be normalin which normal events were treated as abnormal and the abnormal was routinely normalizedEvery reader will have an opinion about Harry and the Royals after reading this book The Press was constantly following him as lazy a drug addict single with no prospects and actually comparing him to Bridget Jonesreally They talked about his ratty shoes and mismatched outfits Later his girlfriends were followed by the press and then there was his life with Meghan when he was finally happy He was told that it will be difficult for her Yet the press wanted him to be married Most of us know he ended up leaving his beloved country to find a better lifeTo live without freedom from the press made him want to expose every secret so there could be nothing left except a man with his wife and children wanting peaceShow more
Rating 3 out of 5,"Edited to clarify my thoughts on January 13, 2023This book was revealing, but also frustrating. Harry spares no punches rightfully pointing out where others have done wrong. However, he fails to consistently apply this same critical eye to his own actions. While he sounds like he feels bad for his missteps, he attributes them entirely to his upbringing with little interrogation. For example:1. Making a big deal of Will and Kate laughing at the Nazi costume. It was wrong of them to laugh and encourage him; however, it was more wrong of him to choose and wear the costume. 2.He lets himself off the hook for his Pakistani slur because he grew up sheltered and his one Pakistani friend forgave him.3. He physically attacks his bodyguard while drunk. 4. One passage that really struck me was “Meg said something I took the wrong way. It was partly a cultural difference, partly an language barrier, but I was overly sensitive that night. I thought: why is she having a go at me? I snapped at her-spoke to her harshly-cruelly…” Harry alludes to saying something awful to Megan, but never says what it was. Could it have something to do with his prior comments about her at the beginning of their relationship, which were quite judgmental for somehow who is sick of being judged by others.  Next to Harry, Prince Andrew gets the kindest treatment of the royals, being referred to only as ""embarrassing""(he sounds more upset about Kate asking Meg to apologize for the baby brain comment). I didn't expect something earthshattering, particularly given his friendship with Eugenie, but I think Andrew's actions merit a bit of a harsher adjective than ""embarrassing""Some more petty thoughts:I still don't believe WIlliam and Kate were huge Suits fans. The show is not that good. 2 I still don't believe Meghan never googled the Royals. She is an intelligent woman and that is literally the most basic thing you do for anyone. 3.I never want to hear about a frostbitten ""todger"" again. If this book accomplishes is to stop the belief that Meghan is a diabolical, controlling mastermind because no one looks good in this book, so I doubt she had any hand in it (she's far too PR savvy in a good way for that). This is all Harry (and his ghostwriter). One stylistic gripe: there were far too many chapters. The book was split into 3 parts, each with about 50-90 chapters. In a book under 500 pages. To me, this detracted from Harry and his GW's ability to actually write a compelling, cohesive narrative. Overall, this was fun, but would have been better with more self reflection. 3.5/5Show more",3,Edited to clarify my thoughts on January 13 2023This book was revealing but also frustrating Harry spares no punches rightfully pointing out where others have done wrong However he fails to consistently apply this same critical eye to his own actions While he sounds like he feels bad for his missteps he attributes them entirely to his upbringing with little interrogation For example1 Making a big deal of Will and Kate laughing at the Nazi costume It was wrong of them to laugh and encourage him however it was more wrong of him to choose and wear the costume 2He lets himself off the hook for his Pakistani slur because he grew up sheltered and his one Pakistani friend forgave him3 He physically attacks his bodyguard while drunk 4 One passage that really struck me was Meg said something I took the wrong way It was partly a cultural difference partly an language barrier but I was overly sensitive that night I thought why is she having a go at me I snapped at herspoke to her harshlycruelly Harry alludes to saying something awful to Megan but never says what it was Could it have something to do with his prior comments about her at the beginning of their relationship which were quite judgmental for somehow who is sick of being judged by others  Next to Harry Prince Andrew gets the kindest treatment of the royals being referred to only as embarrassinghe sounds more upset about Kate asking Meg to apologize for the baby brain comment I didnt expect something earthshattering particularly given his friendship with Eugenie but I think Andrews actions merit a bit of a harsher adjective than embarrassingSome more petty thoughtsI still dont believe WIlliam and Kate were huge Suits fans The show is not that good 2 I still dont believe Meghan never googled the Royals She is an intelligent woman and that is literally the most basic thing you do for anyone 3I never want to hear about a frostbitten todger again If this book accomplishes is to stop the belief that Meghan is a diabolical controlling mastermind because no one looks good in this book so I doubt she had any hand in it shes far too PR savvy in a good way for that This is all Harry and his ghostwriter One stylistic gripe there were far too many chapters The book was split into 3 parts each with about 5090 chapters In a book under 500 pages To me this detracted from Harry and his GWs ability to actually write a compelling cohesive narrative Overall this was fun but would have been better with more self reflection 355Show more

Rating 2 out of 5,"As a fan of J.R. Moehringer's previous work I was looking forward to reading this book. His previous ghostwritten book for Andre Agassi is one of the best sports memoirs of all time capturing Agassi's brilliance and self-destructiveness with compassion and honesty. This book is not in the same class. For all that Prince Harry provided plenty of tabloid-worthy anecdotes the whole thing is a bit flat in both tone and scope. The constant metaphorical flourishes are clunky and overplayed - Westminster Abbey is a palace of death, the Queen symbolised as a hummingbird.Harry himself, although a man who has suffered greatly through the loss of his Mum and the tabloid obsession with him, doesn't come across as especially sympathetic. He seems like hard work most of the time, forever obsessing about trivial slights and angrily reflecting on his family's refusal to recognise his superior insight. Sometimes he sounds more like Alan Partridge than a Prince, particularly when he's sneering at a female journalist who wrote a book about him ""One of this lot, who’d written a book about me and thus provably depended on me to pay her rent"" or writing about a school matron who he and his friends found ugly.Good things about the book: it's a quick read, Harry seems well-intentioned in his quest against tabloid journalism (if probably doomed to fail) and his love for Meghan is very clear. He seems to view her as his saviour and it's not hard to understand why. The bad parts: more penis anecdotes than seem strictly necessary, Harry's lack of insight into why his family may have found him frustrating, his occasional meanness about others and tendency to overstate his own historical importance, as well as the heavy-handed metaphors and overall flatness of the book.

Rating 2 out of 5,"Some of it is interesting, and I’m sure there is some truth in what he says about the (rather weird) life of the royals, but it mostly reads as a long whine by a very cosseted and indulged man who has never really grown up. His gratuitous trashing of his family - when he knows protocol means they will never answer back - is contemptible, as is his boasting about his Taliban kills, etc. Harry justifies it all by shifting blame, for instance by insisting in interviews that the press “spins” his words and quotes them out of context, but he knew and intended that this book would be sensational, or else what was the point of it, and why would he have been paid so much to publish it? Some hypocrisy there, I think, Hazza? The fingerprints of Meghan are all over it, and what is she really? A self-centred, second rate actress who got lucky and by clever scheming, managed to land herself a prince. Both she and Harry talk a lot about how wonderful they are, but what have they actually done? Not much. Above all, I feel for his children because this stuff never dies, although Harry seems to have given little or no thought to that, however compassionate he claims to be.

Rating 5 out of 5,"I want to preface this review by saying I am not monarchist and actually feel very opposed to the Royals (as does anyone with a brain in the 21st century) However, I really liked this book and enjoyed particularly the unflinching honesty. He speaks about a variety of things that do not paint him in a good light and I appreciate that this is not just another memoir that is a highlight reel of all the good things they have done. I think this book has caused a stir because all of the old people who love the royals are now seeing that the institution they defend so vehemently is undeniably toxic and racist. Oh and harbours sex offenders. I have a feeling these same people knew this already and feel like fools so are acting out and rating it badly and calling him a liar or a traitor. I really don’t see how its anyone else's business whether he speaks to his brother or Dad, again I don’t know why this has triggered all the oldies, he's not your kid or brother, get a grip. Where was all this anger and vitriol when Andrew gave 12 million to someone he raped? Or when the palace staff were racist AGAIN? Overall I think it’s a good book and it's nice to hear someone's story from them instead of the shit rag newspapers that make up lies (again, surely anyone with a brain doesn’t read the UK tabloids?)

Rating 5 out of 5,"HuntedReading Prince Harry's autobiography, the reader quickly picks up on the fact that he has felt hunted much of his life. That comes as no surprise, given the circumstances of the media in our time of cameras and internet media. Behind much of his story is the fact, as he said, that the last sound his mother heard in this life was the click of a camera as she lay dying. Of course, the press has gunned for him since his teen years. He shares that for years he wanted to believe that his mother had just gone into hiding to get away from the media. He also shares that after his years in the war he eventually realized that he himself had problems with post-traumatic stress and anxiety. ""Destruction is partially creative. It begins with imagination. Before destroying something you have to imagine it destroyed.""He shares much about the relationship dynamic between the members of the royal family. And, he discusses the relationships that preceded Megan and the fact that they couldn't deal with the press attention. Then, he takes the reader through his love affair with his wife, and their life together. It is a well written and openly honest account of his family life, his work, his mistakes, and his hopes and dreams. And, his mother is every bit a part of much of what he has to say.

Rating 2 out of 5,"Buckle up, bitches.Here's where I'm coming from, going into this: Nosiness. That's it. I watched the Oprah interview, I watched most of the Netflix documentary, I'm not a fan of either of them but I don't hate them either - I'm indifferent. Couldn't care less what they do or who they do it with, I don't read newspapers, I grew up in the era of Heat magazine and saw what the press did to people like Jade Goody, Britney Spears - hate the paps, hate the papers, hate the media - so that's why I decided to read (or listen to) this myself to form my own opinion because I knew it'd be everywhere AND I AM NOSY. The book is split into three parts. Part One focuses on his childhood and covers losing his Mum, which I found incredibly sad. He was in complete denial about her death for several years, to the point where he kept referring to it as ""her disappearance"" because he thought she had orchestrated a vanishing act in order to escape the paps. He was convinced that she'd come back for he and William one day. There are a couple of silly cringe things in this part (like Prince Charles sniffing everything and having to bow every time they pass a statue of Queen Victoria, and the revelation that the water in the taps at Balmoral is the colour of weak tea) but overall it's just about how nobody really helped him deal with his mother's death (because he didn't believe she was dead). Interestingly he doesn't seem too bothered about how William was coping. There's a lot about shooting animals (or ""culling""), and a particularly gruesome episode (I think chapter 27) of him shooting a deer for the first time. He says 'Mummy' about fifteen hundred times in Part One, and goes on (and on and on and on) about a biro that Princess Margaret gave him one Christmas. Part Two mainly focuses on his education and army training. The lack of awareness around his privilege here is staggering - he really doesn't seem to realise that being able to avail of so much education and training, on top of travelling the world, isn't something available to everyone. He's constantly talking about going on the piss or taking drugs, and at one point boasts about smoking ""a shopping bag full of weed"". He speaks about the press hounding him, but he's completely obsessed with them. As I'm not partial to a toke on the old Mary Jane rolls myself, I can't say whether or not weed-induced paranoia has a part to play in his obsession with the press - I can't imagine it has helped. William, as second-in-line to the throne, was also left motherless and endlessly persecuted by the press, and he doesn't really feature in this whole misery-fest. In fact, the times when William is portrayed as being furious are times when Harry has gotten away with something he'd never be able to do, but more on that later. There's a lot of war shite in Part 2, where he really doesn't seem to care that he has killed 25 enemies. That's all they are - enemies. Not humans. He says of one ""kill"" - ""Taking him meant saving British lives"". Death is a huge theme throughout the entire book, which he acknowledges near the end.Part Three is the part I wanted going in - this covers from when he met actress Meghan Markle right up to the present. This part was a little contradictory in parts - at one stage everyone loves her, then they all hate her, then they're coming for her and making her cry, then they're apologising to her, then they like her again - it's all very muddled. What I took from it personally was that Harry was at the stage where he really, really wanted to settle down and have a family but none of his exes were prepared to give up their lives to live in the fishbowl. Meg did - she took on the royals and I think she saw it as an opportunity to further her activism and make a real difference both to her campaigns and to the royal family, injecting some new blood (literally). I don't believe that she didn't Google them, but I do believe she didn't think that they'd be so ""royal"" behind closed doors. I think she genuinely expected to have a Backstage Pass and meet Harry's Granny, feet up, slippers on - so when she was expected to curtsy and adhere to royal protocol, that came as a shock. There's a lot about him having this fantasy that He, Meg, Will & Kate will be like this fab foursome who'll lunch together and double date - but he and William don't appear to have been that close to begin with?! I think there's a ton here that's not being talked about, tbqh. Half the time it was ""Willy ignored me at school"" but later he'd mention how they'd come up with a secret code (""on mother's life"") to be invoked only when one brother really wanted the other to listen to him. There's a lot of jealousy on both parts - he's jealous because Willy is higher up the ranks than he is, and Will's jealous because Harry gets away with shit he's not allowed do. Harry could choose his own wedding clothes and leave his beard on, Willy wasn't allowed to do either. ""The Big Fight"" (the dog bowl & the necklace) is standard brother stuff - a bit of shouting and pushing but nobody even hits the other. (My sister used to bite me, Harry). The British Press are truly disgusting - and always have been. The way Meghan was treated was appalling, and there's no excuse for it. But I think that Harry has a role to play here - his obsession with himself and what's being written about him is scary. At one point he's talking about speaking to Elton John about Elton's upcoming memoir, and Elton mentions that it's being serialized in the Mail - Harry hits the roof and reels off a list of stuff the Mail have written about Elton. How or Why would he know about it unless he was reading it CONSTANTLY?! When Meghan tells him that she feels she'd be better off if she weren't here anymore (and she's pregnant at the time), he was going to leave her to go to an engagement. She didn't trust herself alone so she went with him and cried the whole time they were there, in the dark, while squeezing his hand. This man had been in therapy himself at this point so it's baffling to me how he includes this story and doesn't think it'll make him look like anything other than a massive POS. He should honestly thank his lucky stars that anyone ever agreed to marry him because he becomes more insufferable as the book goes on.Did I enjoy the book? Kinda. I think Parts 1&3 were engaging, and that's probably down to a talented ghostwriter. Part 2 was the most boring thing I've listened to in years and you couldn't pay me to do it again. I wanted to hear more about the Royal Family as a business - he talks about getting his clothes from TK Maxx, and about receiving a clothing allowance, but also says that he hasn't touched Diana's inheritance and that he was jealous seeing William's house full of antiques and art when they'd had to buy a sofa online on Meghan's credit card. He talks about doing his shopping, but also says that he never carried cash or bought anything online. How the hell did he get to Vegas for his lad's trip, then?! How did he buy the weed? I would've loved ""A day in the life of a Prince"". I would have loved more insight into William and how he coped after Diana's death, because Harry barely acknowledges the trauma and level of additional pressure on The Heir. I'm only glad I read it so that I can avoid FOMO, and I'm telling you now, if Meghan writes a book I'm not reading it. Tell you who I want a book from, Angela. The Queen's dresser who he would BURN. That woman has some gossip.....Things that amused me:- The idea that Charles goes around sniffing everything- Meghan thought Andrew was the Queen's assistant- When Harry moved out, Camilla turned his bedroom into her dressing room- Harry credits some seals with Meghan getting pregnant- He won't write about NOTW editor Rebekah Brooks and repeatedly calls her ""Rehabber Kooks"" as if either of those words make sense- He does a seal impression twice- He calls the aforementioned Ms Brooks ""an infected pustule on the arse of humanity""- Will & Kate didn't want to sit beside each other at Harry & Meg's weddingI want the record to show that I immediately downloaded this, turned the Wi-Fi off and refunded it. He can buy his next shopping bag of weed with someone else's money. xShow more",2,Buckle up bitchesHeres where Im coming from going into this Nosiness Thats it I watched the Oprah interview I watched

Rating 5 out of 5,"This book is not what the tabloids wanted to be able to criticize. It provides context for the wildly out of context things the media puts forward. It gives grace to his family for a lot of their friction, showing an understanding of how complex different backgrounds and cultures are, and it unpacks a lot of stuff that is far overdue to be unpacked within his family (I will criticize him for still believing that monarchy can work - he still needs to unpack how monarchy is inherently dated and problematic and it's not just his family's differences.) It shows a side to him that he hasn't been able to show. He's allowed to be a primary source for one of the first times ever. It's clear how much he loves his wife and how much he loves his children.It's also clear that the most fundamental part of him is how much he loves his mother, how much he misses her, and how much her loss and the circumstances surrounding it traumatized him. Harry is a very privileged man in many ways. But you can be privileged in some ways and a victim in others. He is certainly both. If one looked at the constant formality, the coldness, the lack of physical affection within his family, how he was taught to never cry, never have deep conversations, never be anything but exactly what he was supposed to be, and placed that same scenario within a poor, underprivileged family, we'd all see it for what it was. Neglect, abuse, toxicity. That part of it doesn't go away because he's rich. As I read this I thought back to my childhood and how, while I didn't understand so much of how awful it can be to be famous, I did always know one thing (perhaps due to a children's book about Diana that I found in my elementary school library a couple years after she died): that I did not want to be famous. That I want to blend in. And if I'd not even had that choice, I don't know that I'd be alive today.This is a deeply traumatized person in many ways, including being taken advantage of by others for money and their own fame his entire life. He's taking back the power now, and while he's still a work in progress (see his opinions on the concept of monarchy) he's done a lot of work and he's determined to break that cycle.And in case this isn't already clear - I believe every word he says.Show more",5,This book is not what the tabloids wanted to be able to criticize It provides context for the wildly out of context things the media puts forward It gives grace to his family for a lot of their friction showing an understanding of how complex different backgrounds and cultures are and it unpacks a lot of stuff that is far overdue to be unpacked within his family I will criticize him for still believing that monarchy can work  he still needs to unpack how monarchy is inherently dated and problematic and its not just his familys differences It shows a side to him that he hasnt been able to show Hes allowed to be a primary source for one of the first times ever Its clear how much he loves his wife and how much he loves his childrenIts also clear that the most fundamental part of him is how much he loves his mother how much he misses her and how much her loss and the circumstances surrounding it traumatized him Harry is a very privileged man in many ways But you can be privileged in some ways and a victim in others He is certainly both If one looked at the constant formality the coldness the lack of physical affection within his family how he was taught to never cry never have deep conversations never be anything but exactly what he was supposed to be and placed that same scenario within a poor underprivileged family wed all see it for what it was Neglect abuse toxicity That part of it doesnt go away because hes rich As I read this I thought back to my childhood and how while I didnt understand so much of how awful it can be to be famous I did always know one thing perhaps due to a childrens book about Diana that I found in my elementary school library a couple years after she died that I did not want to be famous That I want to blend in And if Id not even had that choice I dont know that Id be alive todayThis is a deeply traumatized person in many ways including being taken advantage of by others for money and their own fame his entire life Hes taking back the power now and while hes still a work in progress see his opinions on the concept of monarchy hes done a lot of work and hes determined to break that cycleAnd in case this isnt already clear  I believe every word he saysShow more
Rating 5 out of 5,"Review Below! I finished late last night, review will be written later today. One thing I can say right now. HARRY HAS DESERVED NONE OF THIS. The media is as corrupt as the British government. Harry hasn't said one bad word about his family. Period!It's release day. I'm currently listening to the book on audible as it's narrated by Harry himself, I feel its important - at least to me - to hear his story from him. Please check back in a few days for my full review. Anyone 1 starring this book before it's even released based on the BS propaganda posted in the media, have zero basis for writing any real and informed review of books, any books, not just this one. I hope your hatred towards someone who's experienced real and torturing trauma keeps you warm at night because you literally have nothing else going for you, you are easily manipulated by the media and that's the real tragedy here, not a prince, a man, a husband, father writing a book about his experience.ReviewAhhh Dearest Harry, what has the world done to you? I've mostly been indifference to Prince Harry through majority of my life, id read the newspaper articles and the magazine covers, the headlines, and never really cared to much, until recent years, until Meghan came along and sent the world crazy. I never believed majority of the headlines and articles written by Harry and Meghan, however the constant and consistent was certainly making me wonder whether there was indeed some fact behind them. fast forward a few years and along came the Opera interview, and immediately my opinion changed, i believed them, i pitied them . I saw them fighting back and it was great to see (not the bashing they received but the determination to clear their names and tell the truth)It was then that i knew for definite that the media were liars, they (the media) were tying so hard and coming up with wild and crazy accusations to H and M up. i watched the Netflix series when it aired and was shocked at some of the tactics the media used, the way they manipulated M's dad and the way they manipulated the British public. Many a time people said they hated them and when i asked why, what had they done to you? they couldn't answer, and those who did just repeated headlines and when i pushed for an explanation they went quiet, they didn't know! they didn't know why they hated H and M … i suppose it appeared to be the ""cool"" thing the ""in"" thing and they didn't dare to be different. Then along came ""spare"" boy did that have the media in a frenzy! were they scared? were they scared of Harry exposing the truth, were they scared that their cash cow was no longer theirs to abuse? The newspaper reports, the radio shows and twitter have been in a craze. Harry said this in his book, Harry said that in his book, completely taking what was said out of context (deliberately of course to try and stop people buying the book, to stop the medias lies being exposed.Without going into to much detail and ruining the book for you, ill give you a quick over view of what in ""Spare"" Harry talks about his childhood and his relationship with William, who he affectionately calls Willy. Now we used an audible credit and enjoyed the book narrated by Harry himself, so imagine my Husbands delight and chuckles every time Harry said Willy, my husband is nearly 41, you'd think he'd be passed that by now, but no there he sat chuckling at every mention of Willy. He spoke about time at Eton and it was then when the brothers started to drift apart not after Meghan entered his life , which the Press would have you believe. He spoke of Charles and Camila , again with affection. He also spoke of the death of his mother and how the press took photos of her dying in the car and didnt try to help her . Harry also spoke of his time in the Army and how the media exposed his position and he had to be pulled out, not just for his safety but for every one of his squad mates. Harry spoke of his relationships, all of whom the media had destroyed. Harry went to talk on about his PTSD and his charity work and then finally his relationship with Meghan. On the contrary to the trolls on twitter Harry didn't whinge and moan through out his book, he gave an honest account of his life, frost nipped Penis and all! you simply cant have an autobiography without showing the low points of your life too, that's not how it works!if you're on the fence about reading ""spare"" I recommend you do, even if you don't like him, at least hear his truth and then decide. if he changed your mind and you now realise how you were manipulated by the press, that's okay! we were all manipulated!if for some reason my review is being flagged up and hidden for spoilers, please message me. it appears as if the trolls on this website have been flagging up reviews for spoilers of those who are in support of Harry. 5 big fat beautiful stars for the gentle soul that harry is!

Rating 5 out of 5,"“Never complain, never explain.” That is the motto of the Royal Family. That is what Prince Harry has had to live with his entire life, through the death of his mother to countless false accusations from the British press. Imagine someone blatantly lying about you, telling the whole world those lies and you have no chance of telling the world your truth. Prince Harry could never tell his side of the story, until now.‘Spare’ is an incredible memoir. The story of Prince Harry is one of a kind, be it for good or for bad. The raw honesty was what made this a compelling read, Harry is someone who is an intellect and very introspective and that shines through. Prince Harry talking about losing his mother, Princess Diana, is truly heartbreaking. He mentions her several times throughout the book as he would think of her at key moments of his life which I found quite emotional. The dynamics of his relationship with his father was also fascinating as although he loves his father, it is a relationship that is warm from one side but cold from the other. Prince Harry is someone who wants to love and be loved, he wants affection, hugs and kisses. That however isn’t the way of the Royal Family. For me, the highlight of this book was him opening up about his relationships to those in his family. The dynamics, the hurdles, the ups and downs, I can only imagine doing this book for Prince Harry was like one big long therapy session.It’s easy for people to point at Prince Harry and say he’s privileged or that he’s a member of the Royal Family and his life belongs to the people and all the other common tropes. However, despite everything he is a human with human feelings. He’s been conditioned to mask his emotions, to curb his human tendencies and to behave instead in a robotic non-emotive way. For someone who is a deep soul, that must’ve been its own hell for Prince Harry.For those criticising Harry for writing this book because he’s jeopardising the Royal Family, to you I say he’s merely responding to the fabrication of lies that have come from not just the British press but also through leaks from the Royal Family themselves. You can’t criticise Prince Harry but then think it’s fine for King Charles or Prince William to be giving the green light for negative articles on Prince Harry to be written. I think many people are hating on this book because they feel threatened by the truth. The truth can be uncomfortable. There are many Royalists that are upset but you have to accept that sometimes the people you idolise aren’t the angels you think they are. The Royal Family are an imperfect family like many of ours and you’ve heard one side of the story for decades, albeit indirectly fed through the press.

Rating 4 out of 5,"3.5 stars* (Yes I have actually read this)An enjoyable memoir, while the leaked excerpts were mostly correct, they flowed a lot more within the book. None of it seemed out of place. I’m not a monarchist/royalist, i firmly believe that they shouldn’t be part in a modern society. I disagree with Harry on a number of things, such as his respect for the monarchy and military. However, I do find it interesting to hear his perspective of these things, on his experience.I know a lot of people bang on about how he left the royal family for privacy (he didn’t, he left to protect his wife and family from harassed by paps) and now he wrote a book, which is somehow hypocritical. To me it’s obvious that Harry is airing all his dirty laundry so that the tabloids can longer hold it over his head, the stories are told on his terms not some person who calls themselves a ‘royal expert’.

I might at a later point decide to add some more thoughts on this review - but what strikes me after having just finished it is that besides a life marked by being denominated as the Spare - Prince Harry's life was also decidedly marked by being a soldier - be it literally or more figuratively. This autobiography was engaging, heartfelt, and at times soul-crushing. Altogether, it is a claiming of one's own narrative and life story - a story that has been (at times purposefully) misportrayed by the media - and therefore valid in its own right.october 2022can people just STOP RATING unpublished books (that are not ARCs). it makes literally no sense. thanks for coming to my ted talk.Show more",5,Out of the night that covers meBlack as the pit from pole to poleI thank whatever gods may beFor my unconquerable soulIn the fell clutch of circumstanceI have not winced nor cried aloudUnder the bludgeonings of chanceMy head is bloody but unbowedBeyond this place of wrath and tearsLooms but the Horror of the shadeAnd yet the menace of the yearsFinds and shall find me unafraidIt matters not how strait the gateHow charged with punishments the scrollI am the master of my fateI am the captain of my soulSpare is divided into three Parts Each Part is titled with a part of this poem  Invictus  by William Ernest Henley I admit I hadnt ever heard of it before but it serves as a great and incredibly poignant theme throughout Prince Harrys life I might at a later point decide to add some more thoughts on this review  but what strikes me after having just finished it is that besides a life marked by being denominated as the Spare  Prince Harrys life was also decidedly marked by being a soldier  be it literally or more figuratively This autobiography was engaging heartfelt and at times soulcrushing Altogether it is a claiming of ones own narrative and life story  a story that has been at times purposefully misportrayed by the media  and therefore valid in its own rightoctober 2022can people just STOP RATING unpublished books that are not ARCs it makes literally no sense thanks for coming to my ted talkShow more

Rating 3 out of 5,"Seething and jealous Harry absolutely despises the monarchy, he and Meghan have said so to the tune of $120Million+ in interviews, tv series, complaints to the media and this book. He has just had his daughter christened Princess Lilibet (and his son will be Prince Archie). I don't believe Harry despises the monarchy at all, he has just spent his whole life seething and jealous that he will never be King. Using titles for his children, ensures he and Meghan more prime time tv dollars, but how long before everyone sees through him and sees he will do anything to hang on to royal connections as that is all he (who has no discernible skills or talents apart from killing Taliban) and his tv actress wife have to sell?They never went to America for privacy, they went so they could control the media and make money and for Meghan so she didn't have to work and could just be the A-list celebrity she has always believed was her due.__________It has been suggested to me that I link the review of Courtiers: Intrigue, Ambition, and the Power Players Behind the House of Windsor to this book, as the book gives a different, insiders perspective of Harry. So I am :-) Thank you Margaret__________The Daily Mail got sued by Meghan, who won printing extracts from her 'private' letter to her father who had sold it to them, even though she had friends leak contents to People - and then had her friends' names protected by release in open court. Even though she admitted the letter had been composed with the aid of her staff in Kensington Palace. I always wondered why she won, but she did. so of course they have it in for her. But since she sued and won, they are going to take great care that everything they write will stand up to judicial scrutiny. And they found a lot of discrepancies between what Harry wrote and what actually happened. Anyway read it yourself if you can muster up the interest! helicopter instructor For those that think I have a bit of a soapopera mind, this is true, my first blog was called SoapOpera, I own it. So, Harry has a very faulty memory (forgiven!) and crap factcheckers (guilty) and maybe Harry and the ghostwriter just thought it made a better story told that way. __________I'm really upset that Goodreads have censored, hidden this review in Community Reviews I don't see that it's controversial. Goodreads did reply but this goes on so I'm putting the wholke thing in spoilers. There are a lot of hidden reviews for this book, some with thousands of likes that have been downgraded to the back lot. What is so special about this book that although GR's search box says 'popularity' they are in any order but that!  I have written to them but doubt they will even answer. What is so objectionable about the review they hide it? And why didn't they tell me Update> I wrote to GR and they replied they didn't see any issues. Twice they wrote they had forwarded it to the IT dept. I don't think the IT dept makes decisions on what reviews should be seen, which should be hidden and review order that is different in Spare than any other book. The default order on the new book page is popularity. I know of reviews with over 2K votes (a 1 star), there are many reviews with a lot of votes, but the first page has reviews with just 7 votes. What is going on? __________Review Harry meets Meghan, the first four dates. Recollections varied.  I think I am the only person or media to actually write about this, so I'm not sure what that means. First a note on the two versions. In the book Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of a Modern Royal Family and in all the media, Omid Scobie, the author denied that Meghan and Harry had any input at all into the book. Meghan denied it too. Then there was a court case against the Daily Mail, which she won. In court she had to finally admit that she had collaborated fully. She had suggested events and chapters and given details and even dialogue to the authors. So I am presuming what I read in Finding Freedom was the truth according to Meghan as she had no reason not to say it and that Harry's recollections .. varied!,Harry's version. He sees her on Instagram with his friend Violet. He tells Violet he has never seen anyone so stunning and Violet says, ""I can connect you guys, if you like."" Harry replies, ""Um, yes. Please?"" Then, ""Violet asked if it would be all right to give the young woman, the American, my Instagram handle."" Shortly afterwards she messages him, they exchanged phone numbers and text late into the night. Next morning, they text on and off all day, breaking for meals. ""I couldn't type fast enough. My thumbs were cramping. There was so much to say, we had so much in common."" Harry googled her, of course, and then asked for a date for the next day. He turns up late and the date is cut short when she says she has to leave to go to dinner. Meghan says she will arrange flowers for Violet. Later she Facetimes him and they set up a second date in the same place, Soho House, for the next day, 4th July. They are at dinner, the waitress catches them in a kiss, Harry says, ""Not our first"". They check calendars and he invites her for a third date in Botswana. When they get to the camp, Harry describes the tent. ""The tent was very small, and very Spartan. If she'd been expecting some glamping trip, she was now fully divested in that fantasy."" Time for bed. ""There were separate bedrolls,"" then, ""we pushed them together."" Next morning Harry says he walked down to the main camp for a piece of toast.  On the way to their fourth date, quite a long time later back in London, again in Soho House where Meg was staying, Harry says, ""I felt pretty sure she hadn't googled me Delusional. Of course she did. Who wouldn't?  because she was always asking questions. She seemed to know almost nothing - so refreshing. It showed she wassn't impressed by royalty. As I said, delusional.  So this is their fourth date. He goes to her room and they hang a 'Do not disturb' sign on it. Now Meghan's version of the first four dates. ""Despite reports that Violet von Westenholz had set up the date, it was mostly Meghan's pals, Misha Nonoo and Markus Anderson who were in on the first meeting."" Misha thought Meghan could be a match for Harry whom she knew through her ex husband's social circle and because her ex-husband's brother had dated Pippa Middleton. ""Friends thought it would be good for them both to just get out there and date.""""Naturally both participants in this blind date did their homework with a thorough Google search. "" Harry saw her on Instagram and ""liked what he saw but didn't necessarily think of drinks as anything more than a chance to be introduced to a woman he found attractive."" Apparently what Meghan saw online could have, 'easily convinced her to call the whole thing off.' Digression into his drunkness, naked games in Las Vegas, Nazi uniform and other bad boy stuff that is only meaningful because he is a Prince. But Meghan 'who had her own small taste of tabloid interest', knew that the media didn't always get the story right."" She didn't know much about him at all, other than what had been written,"" a friend said, ""She knows how wrong the tabloids can be and she wanted to know who the real Harry was."" She told her friend, she'd settle for a 'nice English gentleman to flirt with'. But said to her agent and friend, ""I'm going on a blind date tonight."" Who is he? was the question. ""I'm sure you know him. It's Prince Harry.""So her friend Markus, global director of membership for Soho House, set them up in a private dining area where ""photos of women's private parts adorned the walls."" Meghan told a friend she was initially nervous about the introduction as they came from two very different worlds. Then, all the things that Harry had said they talked on the phone and text over, are repeated as being talked about for the first time on this blind date. There is no hint in Meghan's story that they had connected over Instagram, had endless phone calls and texts at all. ""Around the time of her first encounter she began to follow a mysterious-looking Instagram account."" Harry's private account. So was it a real blind date as in her version or it was the culmination of a couple of mad crazy days chatting, texting and phoning first as in his?The third date according to Meghan was not in Botswana at all. She went to his cottage, 'Nott Cott' in Kensington Palace and later told friends how 'cute' the cottage was. Harry does not mention this visit at all. Were they up to hanky-panky and he thought it would sound better in Botswana, where he said the bedrolls were initially apart as he ""didn't want to be presumptuous""? Their fourth date was camping in Botswana. Harry remembers this as a spartan zip up tent with bedrolls. The Meghan version: ""Harry and Meghan spent much of their trip in one of the $1,957-a-night deluxe tents. The word ""tent"" might be somewhat of a misnomer for the fully serviced accommodation at Meno A Kwena. With teak king-size beds..."" and each tent had a fully-equipped en suite bathroom and a terrace where breakfast was served to them. Harry remembers breakfast as having to wander down to the main camp to get a slice of toast as his tent was so basic. Their fourth date was in Toronto and not London, according to Meghan. Love must have made their heads spin for their recollections to have varied so greatly.__________Review I finished Spare. It is a book of revenge and exploitation by a man who is obsessed with his mother and her death and actually believes she is with him and according to a medium 'giggles' when she sees a Christmas tree ornament of the Queen, falling and shattering. You'd think that the dead would have better things to do than hang around the living for 25+ years as invisible ghosts to see what they are doing. Is this the afterlife? Is this 'heaven'?Harry comes across as small-minded, always in the right and deluding himself he's the good guy in this. He says he's written this because there are two sides and this is his side. But what he really means is that his side is the right side, the others are evil. It's very much in line with politics, results of elections, gender identity etc. One side is always right and the other always wrong. There is never a centrist point and never any points for discussion. Another example is how he hates the press always chasing him for a photograph or a story, and now he is doing exactly the same thing with the US media - feeding it stories, photographs, the media is all right when he's doing the planting of stories.His book is well-titled, his resentment at being the spare knows no bounds. There is a four-book deal. This is the first. The second will be Meghan's. The third will be theirs and the fourth will be... what will it be? Another revenge book of the things they didn't want to say first time round (everyone will be bored) or perhaps a Buckingham Palace Cookery Book. Who knows. But I think I know what book no. 5 is. This is pure conjecture of course. Meghan will have found a billionaire senator who says he can get Meghan into politics. This book will be about her awful marriage to Harry that she put up with for the sake of the children. I'm sure she's keeping a diary, just in case. To sum up, I don't see that such bitchy, entitled vengefulness would be interesting in anyone else, but we all hope for a view into a world we cannot know and can never belong to. But we don't get it.__________I've finished the book, review to come when I've checked something. I believe I have uncovered a major discrepancy about how they met and their first dates. but since no one else/media have mentioned it, I have to check first and that means rereading some of Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of a Modern Royal Family. Omid Scobie, the main author of the book, swore in the book and out of it that there had been no collaboration between Harry and Meghan. Meghan said the same, it was unauthorised and she had no knowledge of it until.... I checked and I was right. __________Reading notes I've just started the book. The first thing that made me laugh was Harry talking to his brother and father after Prince Philip's funeral and they wanted to know why he really left. So Harry says, To claim no knowledge of why my wife and I took the drastic step of picking up our child and just running like hell, leaving behind everything - house, friends, furniture? Really? Sounds like there was a terrible threat to their lives and they hardly had even time to pack a suitcase, rather than a year of discussions and going to live in a fabulous house in Vancouver owned by the Russian billionaire Yuri Milner, on Meghan's $3M, Harry's $11M and his father's $2M a year. __________I didn't watch Oprah, I didn't watch Netflix but I have to in a very guilty way admit I am dying to read this. I am reckoning on 75% whining, outright lying (as in Oprah), fudging the truth, boasting, gossip and saying just how wonderful Meghan is. But I think about 25% might be true, and I'm interested in that but not sure if I will be able to discern it. I don't hold the Royal family in very high esteem. Charles is as corrupt as they come, Kate has spent all her life doing as little work as possible, Queen Camilla is a woman with no moral compass at all. Andrew - well we all know about Andrew, Edward and Sophie are both corrupt, only Princess Anne comes out of this smelling sweetly. I might have been a bit more of a pro-Royal if she had been Queen. As it is I'm not a republican but not a royalist either. Sometimes you can't be one thing or the other. Princess Anne isn't corrupt, she is hard working, she doesn't demand the limelight, and although she is worth $30M over the years she has donated $28M to charity. I am interested to see what Harry has to say about these close relations of his. An arc review has suggested that the ghost writer, J. R. Moehringer a novelist, journalist, film writer and Pulizer prize winner, a man of great achievements and intellect has written the book far more than Harry who is not noted for his academic prowess! It will be interesting to see if he has captured Harry's 'authentic voice' or if he sounds like a brilliant, insightful if vengeful man of great recall and integrity.See … And What Do You Do?: What The Royal Family Don't Want You To Know about the financial affairs the Royals don't want publicised. It's a bit out of date since the suitcases full of money in exchange for citizenship and honours that Charles was getting from Saudi Arabian men (his chief bottlewasher took the fall for it, as he has in the past). Charles says he only solicits money by offering invites and seats next to him at banquets in exchange for donations to charity. But it is his charity. And it is restoring an old house (palace-type, not like ours) he bought in Scotland.

and out of it that there had been no collaboration between Harry and Meghan Meghan said the same it was unauthorised and she had no knowledge of it until I checked and I was right __________Reading notes Ive just started the book The first thing that made me laugh was Harry talking to his brother and father after Prince Philips funeral and they wanted to know why he really left So Harry says To claim no knowledge of why my wife and I took the drastic step of picking up our child and just running like hell leaving behind everything  house friends furniture Really Sounds like there was a terrible threat to their lives and they hardly had even time to pack a suitcase rather than a year of discussions and going to live in a fabulous house in Vancouver owned by the Russian billionaire Yuri Milner on Meghans 3M Harrys 11M and his fathers 2M a year __________I didnt watch Oprah I didnt watch Netflix but I have to in a very guilty way admit I am dying to read this I am reckoning on 75 whining outright lying as in Oprah fudging the truth boasting gossip and saying just how wonderful Meghan is But I think about 25 might be true and Im interested in that but not sure if I will be able to discern it I dont hold the Royal family in very high esteem Charles is as corrupt as they come Kate has spent all her life doing as little work as possible Queen Camilla is a woman with no moral compass at all Andrew  well we all know about Andrew Edward and Sophie are both corrupt only Princess Anne comes out of this smelling sweetly I might have been a bit more of a proRoyal if she had been Queen As it is Im not a republican but not a royalist either Sometimes you cant be one thing or the other Princess Anne isnt corrupt she is hard working she doesnt demand the limelight and although she is worth 30M over the years she has donated 28M to charity I am interested to see what Harry has to say about these close relations of his An arc review has suggested that the ghost writer J R Moehringer a novelist journalist film writer and Pulizer prize winner a man of great achievements and intellect has written the book far more than Harry who is not noted for his academic prowess It will be interesting to see if he has captured Harrys authentic voice or if he sounds like a brilliant insightful if vengeful man of great recall and integritySee  And What Do You Do What The Royal Family Dont Want You To Know about the financial affairs the Royals dont want publicised Its a bit out of date since the suitcases full of money in exchange for citizenship and honours that Charles was getting from Saudi Arabian men his chief bottlewasher took the fall for it as he has in the past Charles says he only solicits money by offering invites and seats next to him at banquets in

Rating 1 out of 5,"No way, no how!Why should anyone in their right mind fork over money to a milquetoast wimp who flipped his entire family the finger - including a dying grandfather and an ailing grandmother?Harry wanted out of his family so he could live on money he didn't earn (and was given by a generous father and this family he hates so much), elsewhere and without the slightest duties to anyone. I'll not contribute to his wealth by paying for a book which essentially exploits exactly the family ties he so desperately wanted to cut. So do leave for good already, and stop playing the victim card!Oh, and if those falling for this ploy do not understand, that his main gain here is his notoriety and value as a trademark and selling point, I really can't help you - other than to suggest to take off those rose tinted glasses. As to giving the proceeds away, fact is that he plans - so far - on donating $1,900,000, but his income from that book deal alone amounts to $20,000,000. The title in combination with just that photo is all you need to read to know what the tone and background of this memoir is.ETA: And indeed, proven right again. As can be read (!!!) in the Spanish and Italian versions of ""Spare"" (all of which are already out), Harry breaks the privacy of his brother, his father, his sister-in-law, his stepmother, his mates in the army, and - as if it didn't matter either - of his first lover. What a fine specimen of an author, resorting to spilling about others, what they don't want spilled on themselves. If there is anything at all that I enjoy about this farce of a memoir, then it is the huge amount of fabulous internet memes this has generated.As to those wishing to read a worthwhile autobiography, try Madly, Deeply: The Diaries of Alan Rickman.

If I had a choice, I wouldn't want this life either.
What is it about Prince Harry's story that is so riveting to us common folks? Is it morbid curiosity about the royal life? Or is it that we can all relate to dysfunctional families and it's hard to look away when it plays out on such a public stage?It must not be easy to be Prince Harry. He lost his mother when he was just 12 years old, and instead of being protected by the adults in his life, he was forced to parade through London behind her coffin in some sort of bizarre show of stoic grief. At a time when he needed abundant love and support, his family became ever more uptight and withdrawn, with their motto of ""never complain, never explain."" I'm not sure how any child growing up in such circumstances could hope for happiness or even normalcy.And yet, against all odds and with many missteps along the way, he grew up to be a soldier and dedicated public servant, and eventually found happiness with Meghan. But through it all, his family seemed determined to keep him silent and in his place, even at great personal cost to him and his wife. Here finally is his chance to tell his story in his own words.And the result is everything I could want in a memoir: heartfelt, reflective, and bracingly honest. Prince Harry doesn't shy away from talking about the mental and emotional toll of his unresolved grief for his mother nor addressing the controversial events of his life. But if you're hoping for jaw-dropping revelations or juicy gossip, this isn't it. I only follow royal news in passing, and there's nothing in here that really took me by surprise.In approaching this, I'd heard a lot of commentary around why Prince Harry felt the need to write this memoir at all, especially when he and his wife have been so expressive about wanting privacy and peace for their family. But after having read this, it totally makes sense.In psychology, there's this concept of the Real Self vs. the Ideal Self, which states that the bigger the gap between who we present to the world and who we really are on the inside, the more cognitive dissonance we feel; whereas the more aligned the two are, the happier we are. For so long, Prince Harry has been toeing the family line while being forced to keep silent about every mischaracterization and abuse printed about him and Meghan. Thus, the version of him that he showed to the world is not his authentic self. I imagine the mental anguish at having to pretend must wear one down, and it is freeing to finally show the world who he really is.This memoir also has a heck of a love story, and I'm always up for one of those. I've very much respected Prince Harry ever since his deployment days and then seeing all the good that he has done for veterans with the Invictus Games. And while I didn't watch Suits, everything I've come to know about Meghan seems to indicate she is also worthy of my respect, using her fame to support women's rights and social justice. Every time I see them interact, it's clear their love for each other. So to read their love story is a joy, despite all the ugliness that was going on at the time.For me, my personal philosophy has always been to live the life that is most authentic to who I am, and I certainly couldn't begrudge others doing the same. And so I must applaud Prince Harry for having the courage to live his best life and to share his story, even in the face of overwhelming opposition. Good for him.Show more",4,"If I had a choice I wouldnt want this life either

Rating 2 out of 5,"A disclaimer before I start: I’m in neither “love Harry/royals” nor “hate Harry/royals” camp. I’m indifferent, and before this book I knew bare minimum of the dramas of British working and non-working royals. So this is a casual reader’s take, based on the book only, with no sides pre-taken.———————When I was a kid, in the post-Soviet entertainment desert it seemed that everyone started eagerly watching a few telenovelas that made their way over probably as some kind entertainment humanitarian aid package. The name of one of them, The Rich Also Cry, kept popping into my head the entire time I read this Prince Harry memoir. Now, I’m not a royalist; the idea of hereditary state leadership in the 21st century is laughable to me (but not to Harry, in case you think he’s ever criticizing the institution of monarchy). I also know - or care - very little about the British monarchy. But recently it seems that the coverage of Prince Harry’s book was so omni-present (probably due to very aggressive marketing everywhere) that I succumbed to the “Oooooh, shiny!” moment of book weakness. And so I read it.Unfortunately, for most of it I remained largely uninterested and still indifferent.The problem here is, the things I actually found interesting in Harry’s 38 years of life were mostly not those supporting his goals to get his vision of the truth out. Harry’s focus is on the relentless hounding by the British press and the way tabloids have treated his life, as well as the strange environment of the royal family with the expectations of the royals and his resentment of the “Heir/Spare” roles that he and his brother fell into with the resultant strife, and the shadow of his mother’s death over his life.
“My emotions are complicated on this subject, naturally, but my bottom-line position isn’t. I’ll forever support my Queen, my Commander in Chief, my Granny. Even after she’s gone. My problem has never been with the monarchy, nor the concept of monarchy. It’s been with the press and the sick relationship that’s evolved between it and the Palace. I love my Mother Country, and I love my family, and I always will. I just wish, at the second-darkest moment of my life, they’d both been there for me.And I believe they’ll look back one day and wish they had too.”
The parts that actually sparked my interest — his life as a soldier in Afghanistan, his trips to the North and the South Pole (apart from the penile frostbite that unfortunately was featured more prominently than I ever cared to know about), his anxiety and panic attacks, and the absolutely lovely story of him being so wholeheartedly and unabashedly smitten with Meghan when they met — well, some of them were prominent, and others were too brief, and over too soon, to be replaced by the weight of resentments and strife.Yeah, the problem is that Prince Harry’s life the way it was presented here was just not interesting enough for me to have 400+ pages allocated to it. I think I would have cared more had I been in one of the camps with preconceived notions about him, but I just don’t care, and unfortunately this did not make me care more with just a few exceptions. Although the hounding by the British press does seem awful.
 “Was this really happening? Had it actually come to this? Shouting at each other about place cards and hormones?”
The royal resentments seemed a bit petty to me, honestly. From the beginning there was a bit too much focus on the real or received slights and being given less than his older brother. Harry’s room was smaller, and his brother didn’t want to hang out with him at school, and his brother wanted him to shave his beard, too. Not to mention arguments later on about dresses and wedding details and hormones that made me feel like I was uncomfortably in the middle of a family quarrel that I shouldn’t be witnessing.
“I looked at Willy, really looked at him, maybe for the first time since we were boys. I took it all in: his familiar scowl, which had always been his default in dealings with me; his alarming baldness, more advanced than my own; his famous resemblance to Mummy, which was fading with time. With age. In some ways he was my mirror, in some ways he was my opposite. My beloved brother, my arch nemesis, how had that happened?”
(Hey, Harry, check this out. I’m the oldest child and grandchild in my family. There are 3 albums full of photos documenting every smile and probably every poop of my first couple years of life. My younger brother probably has 3 photos total until he started school. And my room was always bigger than his. After the first kid the novelty wears off, and that’s true even for those of us not planning to inherit British throne.)The death of Harry’s mother, Princess Diana, looms on every page, even as Harry crosses into young and then not so young adulthood. And some moments are truly sad — I mean, what kind of a messed up thing it is to have two very young teenagers paraded among crowds, shaking hands of those strangers crying over the loss of the boys’ mother, pushing their grief onto the shoulders of the children who *actually* knew and loved the woman? But other moments seemed to be dwelled on to keep the thematic thread going — when a leopard comes to the tent where young Harry is, it’s not quite related to his dead mother, is it? And I dare say, neither is the hummingbird in the house.
“I remember the mounds of flowers all around us. I remember feeling unspeakable sorrow and yet being unfailingly polite. I remember old ladies saying: Oh, my, how polite, the poor boy! I remember muttering thanks, over and over, thank you for coming, thank you for saying that, thank you for camping out here for several days. I remember consoling several folks who were prostrate, overcome, as if they knew Mummy, but also thinking: You didn’t, though. You act as if you did…but you didn’t know her.”
What made me roll my eyes a bit from the beginning is how dramatically his frantic flight from the UK was presented from the get-go, in the way that makes one think it was a daring escape with nothing but clothes on their backs under the cover of the night and not a very rich family comfortably moving to another continent:
“When my wife and I fled this place, in fear for our sanity and physical safety, I wasn’t sure when I’d ever come back.”“To claim no knowledge of why my wife and I took the drastic step of picking up our child and just running like hell, leaving behind everything—house, friends, furniture? Really?”
And the moment I start feeling sad for him, he goes and states this about his supposed financial woes. Come one, Harry, we mere mortal may not feel so bad that you’re saving your mother’s vast inheritance:
“The question of how to pay for a home and security kept Meg and me awake at nights. We could always spend some of my inheritance from Mummy, we said, but that felt like a last resort. We saw that money as belonging to Archie. And his sibling.”
The style struck me as odd, too — and I’m not sure if it’s Harry’s style or his ghostwriter’s style. But all those extra-short clipped sentences with each short sentence often making a terse lightning-quick paragraph, random italics, eschewing dialogue punctuation marks. But by the end, after 400+ pages, it stopped grating on my nerves so much, so I suppose I’ll let it go. All in all, this is an okay-ish book with a lot of built-up resentment and unhappiness and not a lot of self-reflection, which is probably more of interest to those who love or hate Harry and not to those of us who are barely aware of his existence. But as far as I’m concerned, I hope he’s happy and safe with his wife and children, and that writing this brought him some sort of inner peace. Although I’d say no family reconciliation.2.5 stars.No more royalty books.

Rating 2 out of 5,the lad's brain is fucking rotted,2,the lads brain is fucking rotted
Rating 1 out of 5,"I purchased this book a few minutes after it was published. I wanted to finish reading it and write a review on the publishing day itself. But it took me around two months to finish reading it. After reading the initial pages, I understood what I had to expect from this book. The writing, accusations and hypocrisy were at an extreme level that it became challenging for me to read it.Even though it was so tough for me to finish reading it, reviewing it is actually very easy for me as I can sum up the whole book in just one sentence. That would be highly unethical for me as a healthcare professional to professionally interpret the behavior patterns of human beings who are still alive by a single line in a book review. So I am abstaining from trying to attempt such an endeavor. If you are someone with common sense and a little knowledge of human behavior, you can easily detect many red flags projecting right at your face throughout this book.Before saying anything more about this book, we must discuss some things about Harry. He was indeed born into the Royal Family, which is one of the richest in the world. But that doesn't mean that whatever he mentions regarding his suffering can't be taken seriously just because he was born with a silver spoon. In fact, I felt there is some truth regarding the sufferings (not all, though) he mentions in this book. He lost his mother and closest friend due to different accidents. Many of his family members seem to treat him as a spare. Those all are pretty difficult things for any teenager to handle within their lives.Harry seems to be an empath (to a certain extent) who had to face many tumultuous experiences. His problems might appear not as severe compared to what some of you had to go through in your own lives. But if we look at it from Harry's perspective, the journey was indeed a tough one. Now coming to the book, there were allegations that it was ghostwritten by someone who had written many famous memoirs in the past. As Harry has not responded to that, let us assume that Harry himself has written it. I also heard a rumor that Harry has signed a multi-book deal. If that is true, the first request I have for Harry is to allow another person to write those books who has better skill in articulating with the readers. If the ghostwriting claims are valid, it will be better to find another writer whose writing style suits Harry's story.The problem with this book is that there are discrepancies in many things Harry mentions. Accountability is treated as a joke, and Harry tries to blame everyone who opposes him. Some sentences make you ponder the level of hypocrisy involved in them. His addiction to drug and alcohol are described in a wayward manner, just like how he publicly dealt with the same in his real life.Even though he seems to be an empath, sometimes he vacillates in his behavior and behaves like someone without empathy, especially during his tirade against his brother, William and when he mentions people he killed in the war by denoting them by kill count.When there are a lot of serious topics to discuss, he seems to be mainly focusing on his beard and private body parts in some parts of this book, which seemed very strange from a reader's perspective.Writing a memoir at a young age is perilous as there should be an adequate number of experiences in their life that make the book interesting to read. Similarly, writing skills are also much more important compared to memoirs of older, well-known people. In Harry's case, there were a few things that attracted the attention of the public (which might be one of the main reasons why this book became a success, along with aggressive marketing). But he sadly fails to connect it convincingly with the readers. There are certain private things that should remain private within the family. It is the personal discretion of the author whether to reveal them to the public in their memoirs or biographies. But when you are doing it, you should do it convincingly. Just look at the way Harry describes him moving to the US. It will confuse the readers more instead of enlightening them about the reason for the same.This is one of the most disappointing memoirs I have read if we look from the angle of the writing style or its content. I can't give any rating above one star to it. (Please note that it is the rating of the book and not the rating of the person- Harry). If the rumors regarding the multi-book deal are correct, I hope that Harry will learn from his mistakes and come up with a better book in the future. When I finally finished reading this book, a strange thought about Harry came to my mind. What would have happened to Harry if Diana, Princess of Wales, was still alive? It is true that Diana had to go through many tough situations in her life. But will her presence have made any difference to Harry's current life?We can view that situation from multiple angles. From one angle, we can say that Harry is now a fully grown individual and he should take responsibility and accountability for everything that happened in his life and no one could have made much difference. But if we look from another angle, we can't deny the fact that Diana's love for her children was so pristine and Harry might have had a better life if she was alive and this memoir would have never happened.

without empathy especially during his tirade against his brother William and when he mentions people he killed in the war by denoting them by kill countWhen there are a lot of serious topics to discuss he seems to be mainly focusing on his beard and private body parts in some parts of this book which seemed very strange from a readers perspectiveWriting a memoir at a young age is perilous as there should be an adequate number of experiences in their life that make the book interesting to read Similarly writing skills are also much more important compared to memoirs of older wellknown people In Harrys case there were a few things that attracted the attention of the public which might be one of the main reasons why this book became a success along with aggressive marketing But he sadly fails to connect it convincingly with the readers There are certain private things that should remain private within the family It is the personal discretion of the author whether to reveal them to the public in their memoirs or biographies But when you are doing it you should do it convincingly Just look at the way Harry describes him moving to the US It will confuse the readers more instead of enlightening them about the reason for the sameThis is one of the most disappointing memoirs I have read if we look from the angle of the writing style or its content I cant give any rating above one star to it Please note that it is the rating of the book and not the rating of the person Harry If the rumors regarding the multibook deal are correct I hope that Harry will learn from his mistakes and come up with a better book in the future When I finally finished reading this book a strange thought about Harry came to my mind What would have happened to Harry if Diana Princess of Wales was still alive It is true that Diana had to go through many tough situations in her life But will her presence have made any difference to Harrys current lifeWe can view that situation from multiple angles From one angle we can say that Harry is now a fully grown individual and he should take responsibility and accountability for everything that happened in his life and no one could have made much difference But if we look from another angle we cant deny the fact that Dianas love for her children was so pristine and Harry might have had a better life if she was alive and this memoir would have never happened

Rating 5 out of 5,"“They will look after the heir and I will look after the spare.” —Princess DianaI still remember the day Princess Diana died. I was very little. I’d just gotten home from school when I walked through the front door and saw the mangled car on the tv. My dad was staring at it motionlessly. I remember asking him what it was. He told me. I vividly remember him ending the explanation with, “The princess died.” His words were completely foreign to me. Princesses don’t die. They fall in love with the prince, get married, and live happily ever after. It couldn’t have been a princess in the car. That just simply couldn’t be real.I share this because I was a child who had no idea who Princess Diana was, but still found it traumatic to learn this could happen to someone like her. The princess didn’t always escape the attic in the end.So, imagine what it was like for Prince Harry. Her children were her world. She was his world. She did everything she could to protect them from the press. And yet, it was the press who ended up killing her in the end. The evil witch got her.Prince Harry’s trauma is overwhelming. He shares what his life has been like with the evil witch constantly invading his life. Paparazzi doing things like trying to provoke him in public to get a shot of him snapping back, all just to make money off of him. He’s always swarmed by the very ones who killed his mother. He’s reminded of that trauma with every camera click and flash.And so, when he got married to Meghan Markle and saw that history was about to repeat itself, he got out. He and his wife escaped the attic. He gave up everything to save his wife from the same tragic conclusion. I’ll never understand people who refuse to empathize with Prince Harry’s choices. He left in order to finally have some control over his own life. Now he doesn’t have to live in fear of his mother’s not-at-all-happily-ever-after.I realize people feel protective of Prince Harry, as he’s Princess Diana’s son, so they want to place all the blame on Meghan. It’s not right. There’s no logic to it. He was unhappy where he was, so walked out and then onto a path of inner peace. I’d say he deserves it after everything he’s been through.He details all of his trauma related to the press in this book. He describes his mother’s death, boarding schools, the Afghanistan tours, dating, and finally, his engagement. All contain examples of how the paparazzi bring nothing but stress, woe, and, in a few cases, life-threatening danger. So, why shouldn’t he be allowed to tell his story? It’s his to tell. Do not believe the tabloids. Have empathy. It’s what his mother would want. Good on him for saving himself. Good on him for not letting the evil witch win this time. Good on him for taking the necessary steps to avoid another brutal car crash take up the entire tv screen. Good on him for not letting the press tell another little girl that princesses don’t always win.Just…Good for you, Harry.

Rating 3 out of 5,"Emotions are high with this book on both sides. I don't want to get into any full-on debates. I will keep the review short and rate it for my enjoyment as I always do with books. The writing is good and Harry's narration is enticing. For me Part One was the best and most insightful (the early years and losing his mother.) Part Two (the school and war years) was a bit of a drag and Part Three (the Meghan years) was questionably interesting. As a ""Royal Watcher"" for many years I will say I was saddened by this release. I know he wanted to clarify a lot of things about his own story. There are happy, sad and frustrating moments in his life. This is Harry's story and I appreciated hearing it.I have so many mixed emotions about this book. I wasn't going to read it but indeed I ended up listening to it. Harry has some valid points (especially regarding the atrocious media) and he has clearly suffered over the years BUT I do have a problem with him airing all this dirty laundry when he knows the other side cannot and will not respond. I've always liked William. I like the way he carries himself in public with grace and poise. I think he will make a good King. All of this is just really sad and I do have some problems with some of the content in the book. I JUST WANT PEOPLE TO REMEMBER THAT THIS IS ONLY ONE SIDE OF THE STORY. It can't be the full story, can it? Harry makes it sound like his family wanted him out because there is so much rivalry and jealousy and it's all a popularity contest. There really has got to be more that he is not sharing. Or is there? He makes it sound like Meghan and him just went about their business and neither did nor said anything to upset anyone. I don't know if I can fully believe that. There are usually two sides to a story and maybe THREE depending on who you believe!! In saying this I do not support nor like the treatment she has received at the hands of some of the press!One thing that bothers me is that Harry did not really write the book. It was J.R. Moehringer. I know this happens with many other books that have ghostwriters but I don't like it when publishers do this. I think the real writer should always be given credit. They could have had by Prince Harry and then in smaller lettering with J.R. Moehringer. Does this bug anyone else when it happens? Am I missing something? I don't have the physical book so I'm not sure if I'm completely correct about this. Perhaps somewhere inside the real author is credited?Show more",3,Emotions are high with this book on both sides I dont want to get into any fullon debates I will keep the review short and rate it for my enjoyment as I always do with books The writing is good and Harrys narration is enticing For me Part One was the best and most insightful the early years and losing his mother Part Two the school and war years was a bit of a drag and Part Three the Meghan years was questionably interesting As a Royal Watcher for many years I will say I was saddened by this release I know he wanted to clarify a lot of things about his own story There are happy sad and frustrating moments in his life This is Harrys story and I appreciated hearing itI have so many mixed emotions about this book I wasnt going to read it but indeed I ended up listening to it Harry has some valid points especially regarding the atrocious media and he has clearly suffered over the years BUT I do have a problem with him airing all this dirty laundry when he knows the other side cannot and will not respond Ive always liked William I like the way he carries himself in public with grace and poise I think he will make a good King All of this is just really sad and I do have some problems with some of the content in the book I JUST WANT PEOPLE TO REMEMBER THAT THIS IS ONLY ONE SIDE OF THE STORY It cant be the full story can it Harry makes it sound like his family wanted him out because there is so much rivalry and jealousy and its all a popularity contest There really has got to be more that he is not sharing Or is there He makes it sound like Meghan and him just went about their business and neither did nor said anything to upset anyone I dont know if I can fully believe that There are usually two sides to a story and maybe THREE depending on who you believe In saying this I do not support nor like the treatment she has received at the hands of some of the pressOne thing that bothers me is that Harry did not really write the book It was JR Moehringer I know this happens with many other books that have ghostwriters but I dont like it when publishers do this I think the real writer should always be given credit They could have had by Prince Harry and then in smaller lettering with JR Moehringer Does this bug anyone else when it happens Am I missing something I dont have the physical book so Im not sure if Im completely correct about this Perhaps somewhere inside the real author is creditedShow more
Rating 3 out of 5,"“Someone should say – hold on stop—this person deserves their privacy. You are not allowed to go there. I go around the world dealing with running and hiding and I can’t take a walk in the park. I can’t go to the store. I have to hide in a room. You feel like you are in prison,” Michael Jackson said in an interview after Princess Diana’s death. He spoke about how the paparazzi put a machine into his toilet to try to capture pictures of him and that the paparazzi chase him on scooters. Jackson has had to intervene and tell his driver to slow down. He confessed that he has had to do that many times. “I’m not a Jacko! I’m Jackson.” “Wacko Jacko. Where’d that come from? Some English tabloid. I have a heart, and I have feelings. I feel that when you do that to me. It’s not nice. Don’t do it.”Have things gotten better since 1997?Let’s take a look at this past September 2022.Blake Lively posts a picture of her pregnant self in a swimsuit on Instagram. “Here are photos of me pregnant in real life so the 11 guys waiting outside my home for a unicorn sighting will leave me alone. You freak me and my kids out.” In Spare, Prince Harry points out a sincere problem with the press. To be clear, it is not the regular press that he has a problem with. It is the paparazzi. As much as he hates the paparazzi, why isn’t he doing more? Why isn’t he pushing for more legal reform? How is it legal to wait outside someone’s doors for days? Why isn’t there more protection for children? Toilet Cams? Hacking phones and putting tracking devices on cars? Can’t we all agree that these activities should be illegal? That is the powerful theme throughout this book.However, I am extremely disappointed in the ghostwriter, JR Moehringer. The book is divided into 3 main sections: Harry’s childhood after Princess Diana died, Harry’s military service, and Meg.  The first two sections were very boring. Where was the tell-all part? Harry wrote about losing his innocence to an “older woman” in one paragraph. What was he feeling? Was this a relationship? The details were missing. There is almost no dialogue in this book, and it is so high-level. It does not feel like I pulled up a chair next to Prince Harry and was experiencing his life. There is an old saying that it is better for an author to show the audience something rather than to tell the audience. However, there was far, far too much telling. During one relationship, Harry broke up with his girlfriend. That was how he put it. No! I want dialogue, feelings. What was said? I want to be invested, and I want to feel your heartbreak and despair. Spare reads like a news article with a few below-the-belt comments sprinkled in. We don’t even make it to Chapter 1 before Harry writes about his brother: “his alarming baldness, more advanced than my own.” Harry, if you want people to have vulnerability and authenticity with you, they have to feel safe. These types of comments are out of bounds. Some passages were very strange like when Harry decided to share with us his frozen junk. Um awkward turtle. But that fault I squarely blame on Moehringer. He also ghostwrote Shoe Dog which is a memoir about the founder of Nike. Holy Smokes! That book was so good that I remember even years later exactly where I was when I was reading that book. Spare is no Shoe Dog.Then, an article came out recently. Prince Harry cut the juiciest bits out of the book. “There are some things that have happened, especially between me and my brother, and to some extent between me and my father, that I just don’t want the world to know. Because I don’t think they would ever forgive me.”As for Prince Harry himself, I would recommend reading Michelle Obama’s book, “The Light We Carry”, specifically the last chapter, “Going High.” Trust me. Michelle Obama has had some very unfair and downright lies published about her in the media. What is her motto? “When they go low, we go high.” Here is a passage from her book that I feel is appropriate here:Are we still supposed to be going high?Okay, what about now? My answer is yes. Still yes. We need to keep trying to go high. We must commit and recommit ourselves to the idea. Operating with integrity matters. It will matter forever.

Rating 4 out of 5,"although i am british but anti-monarchy and am fed up of hearing about the royal family all the time (because trust me, you hear about them ALL the time here), you may be wondering why i decided to read this - and i came up with 4 reasons:firstly, i'm nosy (this is the main reason). secondly, i just love a memoir. thirdly, even though it is annoying, when you grow up in the uk you really can't escape the royals, which i think breeds some natural curiosity. growing up, the royal family will have some kind of presence in your life, whether you like it or not. although i wasn't even alive at the time, i constantly grew up hearing about princess diana's tragic death and the outpouring of grief across the country. i remember celebrating the wedding of prince william and kate middleton at primary school and going to a street party on the day of (although i also vividly remember playing stardoll on my laptop when the actual wedding was being broadcast). i remember celebrating the queen's diamond jubilee in school, and actually still have a ruler and a pencil sharpener  adorned with the jubilee emblem . i remember the wedding of prince harry and meghan markle, which was the first royal event i ever bothered to actually watch live.when prince harry and meghan markle announced their engagement, i was excited. like many people in the uk (despite what the papers led you to believe and have now MADE people believe), i thought meghan would be a great addition to the royal family. i don't agree with the concept of monarchy, but i thought if we're stuck with it, we might as well make some progress towards diversity and have a woman in the royal family who actually speaks her mind and seems to genuinely care about the causes she supports.of course, we all know how that ended. meghan faced a torrent of disgusting, misogynistic, and racist abuse from the british press and a large portion of the british public (especially those who seem to have no minds of their own and just parrot what the papers say) - which still continues to this day. because of how bad things got, harry and meghan decided to step away from the royal family so they could be happy and raise their family on their terms - and who can blame them? i don't.but that's not all the book is about - it actually doesn't discuss any of this until the third part. the first part details harry's childhood and adolescence, mainly exploring his reckoning with grief over his mother's death as he grew up, and the start of his very toxic relationship with the press, starting from the second he was born. the second part details harry's experience training and then fighting in the army, which was, for me personally, the weakest part of the book - for a few reasons, but let's not turn this into an analysis of the ethics of war. (i do think discussions of this part in the press have mainly been written by people who haven’t properly read the book though. a few of the things harry says about the army/quotes from this section have been taken out of context).overall, spare is an interesting and gripping memoir, detailing the kind of life that none of us can really ever imagine. it's also emotionally resonant and very well-written - surely aided by a ghostwriter, but if you know anything about celebrity memoirs, this is hardly a surprise. spare is a great example of what a celebrity memoir SHOULD be - we don't want them to be vague and tiptoe around what happened, we want some shocking bombshells. of course prince harry is immensely privileged, but i still do believe he has the right to tell his story, and the right to tell it on his terms. not everything is always black and white - you can be privileged in some ways and a victim in other ways.my fourth and final reason for reading this - i didn't want to be one of those annoying people who constantly talk about this book, but haven't actually read it. but i have read it now, so i can talk about it all i want.i also highly recommend  this article  and  this youtube video ,which both pretty much express my feelings about this book in more detail than i have time to write. -----------my fave part so far is him quoting faulker and then saying he saw the quote on brainyquote.comShow more",4,although i am british but antimonarchy and am fed up of hearing about the royal family all the time because trust me you hear about them ALL the time here you may be wondering why i decided to read this  and i came up with 4 reasonsfirstly im nosy this is the main reason secondly i just love a memoir thirdly even though it is annoying when you grow up in the uk you really cant escape the royals which i think breeds some natural curiosity growing up the royal family will have some kind of presence in your life whether you like it or not although i wasnt even alive at the time i constantly grew up hearing about princess dianas tragic death and the outpouring of grief across the country i remember celebrating the wedding of prince william and kate middleton at primary school and going to a street party on the day of although i also vividly remember playing stardoll on my laptop when the actual wedding was being broadcast i remember celebrating the queens diamond jubilee in school and actually still have a ruler and a pencil sharpener  adorned with the jubilee emblem  i remember the wedding of prince harry and meghan markle which was the first royal event i ever bothered to actually watch livewhen prince harry and meghan markle announced their engagement i was excited like many people in the uk despite what the papers led you to believe and have now MADE people believe i thought meghan would be a great addition to the royal family i dont agree with the concept of monarchy but i thought if were stuck with it we might as well make some progress towards diversity and have a woman in the royal family who actually speaks her mind and seems to genuinely care about the causes she supportsof course we all know how that ended meghan faced a torrent of disgusting misogynistic and racist abuse from the british press and a large portion of the british public especially those who seem to have no minds of their own and just parrot what the papers say  which still continues to this day because of how bad things got harry and meghan decided to step away from the royal family so they could be happy and raise their family on their terms  and who can blame them i dontbut thats not all the book is about  it actually doesnt discuss any of this until the third part the first part details harrys childhood and adolescence mainly exploring his reckoning with grief over his mothers death as he grew up and the start of his very toxic relationship with the press starting from the second he was born the second part details harrys experience training and then fighting in the army which was for me personally the weakest part of the book  for a few reasons but lets not turn this into an analysis of the ethics of war i do think discussions of this part in the press have mainly been written by people who havent properly read the book though a few of the things harry says about the armyquotes from this section have been taken out of contextoverall spare is an interesting and gripping memoir detailing the kind of life that none of us can really ever imagine its also emotionally resonant and very wellwritten  surely aided by a ghostwriter but if you know anything about celebrity memoirs this is hardly a surprise spare is a great example of what a celebrity memoir SHOULD be  we dont want them to be vague and tiptoe around what happened we want some shocking bombshells of course prince harry is immensely privileged but i still do believe he has the right to tell his story and the right to tell it on his terms not everything is always black and white  you can be privileged in some ways and a victim in other waysmy fourth and final reason for reading this  i didnt want to be one of those annoying people who constantly talk about this book but havent actually read it but i have read it now so i can talk about it all i wanti also highly recommend  this article  and  this youtube video which both pretty much express my feelings about this book in more detail than i have time to write my fave part so far is him quoting faulker and then saying he saw the quote on brainyquotecomShow more

Rating 4 out of 5,"The book consists of short chapters, vignettes if you will, of times and events in Prince Harry’s life leading up to the present when he and his wife Meghan have settled in the US leaving royal life behind. J. R. Moehringer is the ghost writer and the writing is engaging . It may be ghost written, but with Harry’s excellent narration, there was not a minute when I didn’t feel that he was sincere in this intimate look at his life. I’m glad I listened to the audio.I found this to be about a grief stricken boy who received little help from his family in dealing with the trauma of the tragic death of his mother. A boy who becomes a man carrying that grief along with the feelings of inferiority that came with his birth position as the “spare to the heir “ and his treatment as such . It’s also an expose of the relationship between the “firm”( the monarchy) and the press. It’s an illustration of the complexity of the monarchy. An expose of the vile British media. Prince Harry has been criticized for leaving the royal family, but it seems that it was the royal family who abandoned him . When he needed their support to fend off lies and racism towards him and his wife perpetuated by the brutal British press, they remained silent. When Meghan was relentlessly stalked by the paparazzi, they remained silent. Well, King Charles did give Harry some advice : “Don’t read them, darling boy.” I would be surprised if he and Camilla or William and Catherine don’t know every word written about them. There may be two sides to every story, but so far the royals have remained silent just as they did when Harry needed their help. The silence speaks volumes. A big part of it focused on his time on the military, a time when Harry felt he had a purpose, as did his work with the Invictus games. I most enjoyed the parts where he reminisces about his mother, about his trips to Africa, his pride in his military service and the chapters where he tells how he and Meghan met and the early days of their relationship. However, parts were a bit soap opera like, melodramatic : who made who cry , a frost bit “todger” ( new word for me). I found Harry to be brave in baring his feelings , the genuine fear that what happened to Diana could happen to Meghan. I appreciated hearing his story. However, there is the risk that people will tire of hearing it if they feel the need to keep telling it . In my view no further justification is necessary other than this book. I wish Harry and Megan well . I believe they have the capacity to do good in this world and I hope they find peace and happiness in doing so.Show more",4,The book consists of short chapters vignettes if you will of times and events in Prince Harrys life leading up to the present when he and his wife Meghan have settled in the US leaving royal life behind J R Moehringer is the ghost writer and the writing is engaging  It may be ghost written but with Harrys excellent narration there was not a minute when I didnt feel that he was sincere in this intimate look at his life Im glad I listened to the audioI found this to be about a grief stricken boy who received little help from his family in dealing with the trauma of the tragic death of his mother A boy who becomes a man carrying that grief along with the feelings of inferiority that came with his birth position as the spare to the heir  and his treatment as such  Its also an expose of the relationship between the firm the monarchy and the press Its an illustration of the complexity of the monarchy An expose of the vile British media Prince Harry has been criticized for leaving the royal family but it seems that it was the royal family who abandoned him  When he needed their support to fend off lies and racism towards him and his wife perpetuated by the brutal British press they remained silent When Meghan was relentlessly stalked by the paparazzi they remained silent Well King Charles did give Harry some advice  Dont read them darling boy I would be surprised if he and Camilla or William and Catherine dont know every word written about them There may be two sides to every story but so far the royals have remained silent just as they did when Harry needed their help The silence speaks volumes A big part of it focused on his time on the military a time when Harry felt he had a purpose as did his work with the Invictus games I most enjoyed the parts where he reminisces about his mother about his trips to Africa his pride in his military service and the chapters where he tells how he and Meghan met and the early days of their relationship However parts were a bit soap opera like melodramatic  who made who cry  a frost bit todger  new word for me I found Harry to be brave in baring his feelings  the genuine fear that what happened to Diana could happen to Meghan I appreciated hearing his story However there is the risk that people will tire of hearing it if they feel the need to keep telling it  In my view no further justification is necessary other than this book I wish Harry and Megan well  I believe they have the capacity to do good in this world and I hope they find peace and happiness in doing soShow more

Shocked the hell out of me. Just for this statement it deserves less than one star. He could’ve just talked about his life being in the military. But NOOO he’d to bring all the white supremacy of the oppressor out here in all its splendor.

Rating 1 out of 5,"This book did the impossible: it made me like Prince King Charles. Poor man got stuck with a wanker for a younger son. I'm not saying his life choices didn't contribute to the problem. But geesh. Every time Harry went on whining about his father I kept thinking, 'But that's not terrible parenting? That is actually surprisingly gentle and understanding on his father's part?'Are we sure the palace didn't have a hand in writing this book? I don't want to minimize the terrible things that have happened to Prince Harry. The loss of his mother, best friend, and military career all clearly impacted him in ways that were not adequately addressed at the time. What makes reading this book so frustrating, however, is his sense of proportion. He ties everything back to being a prince—even (and especially) things that are not unique to royalty. To name a few:* Parental divorce* Sibling dynamics like sharing a room or an older brother who doesn't acknowledge you at school (and laughs when you do stupid things instead of comforting you) * A nonacademic student struggling to connect with a reserved, academic parent* Trying to find your calling/passion in life* Feeling left out as the ""single"" sibling in a family full of couples* Wedding drama over stupid stuff that leaves the bride in tears* Cultural differences when marrying someone from a different country None of those things are unique (without seeking to minimize them, I would say even and including his obvious depression and PTSD) but he seems to think they are. And maybe everything is extra extreme for him as a prince. I'm obviously not in his shoes. But while money can't buy happiness, it sure can make things easier, as he amply demonstrates every time he heads to a different continent to ""get away."" Or when the military spends millions to train him on flying Apache helicopters when he can't just be a ""regular soldier."" Also I just can't get over the amount of time he complains about photos of him in nightclubs/doing drugs/wild parties circulated and then admits to being in all those places and doing loads of drugs. Like, my dude. There is a simple solution to this?? Maybe find a different hobby?The real loser in all of this, unfortunately, is the family he blames so loudly for his problems. He clearly expected them all to have realized he was struggling, but it is obvious even from his own very biased perspective that they were doing their best. He set expectations for them (especially Charles and William) that they didn't know about, so how could they live up to them? While I'm sure Harry's daughter is delightful, it is a pity he didn't have two sons. I think it would have helped Harry come to terms with his own problems with his brother if he could seen the sibling dynamics from a different perspective. Older brothers are older brothers, regardless of whether you define them as Heir and Spare. The trappings of royalty might make it more complicated, but nothing I read showed William as anything other than a typical older brother dealing with stress in his own way. Next to family, Harry blames the paparazzi for the pain in his life. Here he might have more of a point. But I also think even at the heart of it, he really is blaming his family for not ""standing by him"" and denying every statement that hurt his feelings. Once again, though, I was with his family. There isn't much point over fighting over every lie. You'd end up doing nothing else. And if a book like this is what he had in mind with defending his honor...well...I think he kind of proves their point. A lot of it just seems petty. (How dare the palace not clarify after-the-fact in a full press media broadcast that they told Meg not to wear a hat when the paparazzi mocked Meg for not wearing a hat to some random royal function!) What did this book accomplish besides highlighting a lot of stupid drama and illustrating that there is plenty to be frustrated with Harry about completely aside from the rubbish the press dragged up? Maybe I'd have appreciated the book more if I felt it at least showed growth. I'm glad by the end Harry got some counseling. Hopefully he continues on that journey. But the stream-of-conscience style grated on me as a reader. The fragmented style, choppy chapters, and irrelevant stories that never tied back in also left me frustrated. He either over or under shares everything. He presumes an innate knowledge of players and occasions in his life that I simply didn't possess. Then he goes into detail about bowel movements, family jewels, and frostbite situations. The man's sense of TMI is all out of whack. (I understand those are the salacious bits that sold this book for many, but they just him feeling more out of touch than ever. Heading to the South Pole any time soon? Might I recommend a bespoke cozy for your private parts? )And you know, most disappointing of all, not once did he mention the reality TV show I Want To Marry Harry! (Okay, yeah, I'm kidding there, but with how randomly he chooses what to highlight, why not that show? Seemed like positive PR to me.) Bottom line: at many points during this book I thought, 'Was Harry dropped on his head as a baby? Is that what this is about?' and finally I have concluded, 'No. He just did a lot of drugs and never learned to see a situation from anyone's perspective. He does, however, expect everyone to be able to see it from his.' Complaints aside, though, thanks for making me buddy read it with you, Cory.

Rating 2 out of 5,"I feel so conflicted; on one hand, I could not say a thing, and on the other, I feel like I could write an essay about this book.  what is this book aboutin three major parts, this is a book about Harry's life part one losing his mom part two his time in the military part three relationship with Meghan this is just a rough summary  what was the point of the bookPrince Harry tries to convince us that he is better than the rest of ""them"". Harry telling his side of the story and money obviously, both things I can't fault him for- but it stays with me this overall feeling of missed opportunity for a ""better"" book.  standout points of the book* for me definitely is the empathy I feel for two boys who lost their mother at a young age and in front of the whole world, one has to be a cold-blooded monster not to feel for them* harry is very much in love and it shows I like that he finds love with Meghan and he is determined to be the best father to his kids * emphasis on mental health and therapy what didn't workI think that so many details emerging before the release date definitely dampened my ""enjoyment"" of the book. All the influx of interviews and documentaries is also a fact that was overkill. I feel like a good deal of information was contradictory and repetitious. Harry is so proud that he didn't hit his brother back at the time. Instead, he wrote a book about him. So not all hits are with our fists, Harry. He says his brother is balder than him, had bigger rooms, and is the heir. It all sounds extremely petty. Did I really need to know about a royal frozen penis? His first-time story? He lacks accountability in the stories he tells. It is always someone else's fault. The way he mocks a disabled woman is absolutely appalling. The sections of entitlement over Africa. My God. What was that? Only one mention of Andrew, when Meghan mistook him for the queen's assistant. If one thing is crystal clear is that Harry hates the press and paparazzi. He thinks they killed his mother. I don't think he fully moved on from it. I have this impression of underlying anger and resentment. Healing is not done here. And I don't say one ever heals from it, but wounds seem so fresh. Even though I'm not British, I saw how the press was bad for many people. I never want to be part of that circus. But he is obsessed with them. Maybe my main issue is that I am not a royalist, never lived in a Commonwealth country, and don't really care about monarchies. But I can't help but feel like Harry picked and choose when the ""firm"", ""institution"" or whatever you want to call it was at fault in his eyes. It is only when it suited him. In the end I feel sad for Caroline Flack and her family. I feel sad for little boy Harry who lost his mom, his world crumbled, and he didn't get the love he craved. I feel SAD because this wasn't the way to mend fences and heal. This could be an influential book if he took responsibility for his actions. This is not the truth. This is his version of events. Truth is somewhere in the middle and I guess  we never will know it because royals will not tell their side. It must be hard to be born in an institution thousand years old with all the privileges that entail and then realize you are not all that special. Because there are always a positive and negatives to any situation we found ourselves in. Being privileged and rich doesn't exempt you from trauma and suffering but what is the point of explaining yourself to the press you so clearly hate and justifying your actions to the public who will form their own opinions anyway and who in the end buy the tabloids? 1,5 This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review",2,I feel so conflicted on one hand I could not say a thing and on the other I feel like I could write an essay about this book  what is this book aboutin three major parts this is a book about Harrys life part one losing his mom part two his time in the military part three relationship with Meghan this is just a rough summary  what was the point of the bookPrince Harry tries to convince us that he is better than the rest of them Harry telling his side of the story and money obviously both things I cant fault him for but it stays with me this overall feeling of missed opportunity for a better book  standout points of the book for me definitely is the empathy I feel for two boys who lost their mother at a young age and in front of the whole world one has to be a coldblooded monster not to feel for them harry is very much in love and it shows I like that he finds love with Meghan and he is determined to be the best father to his kids  emphasis on mental health and therapy what didnt workI think that so many details emerging before the release date definitely dampened my enjoyment of the book All the influx of interviews and documentaries is also a fact that was overkill I feel like a good deal of information was contradictory and repetitious Harry is so proud that he didnt hit his brother back at the time Instead he wrote a book about him So not all hits are with our fists Harry He says his brother is balder than him had bigger rooms and is the heir It all sounds extremely petty Did I really need to know about a royal frozen penis His firsttime story He lacks accountability in the stories he tells It is always someone elses fault The way he mocks a disabled woman is absolutely appalling The sections of entitlement over Africa My God What was that Only one mention of Andrew when Meghan mistook him for the queens assistant If one thing is crystal clear is that Harry hates the press and paparazzi He thinks they killed his mother I dont think he fully moved on from it I have this impression of underlying anger and resentment Healing is not done here And I dont say one ever heals from it but wounds seem so fresh Even though Im not British I saw how the press was bad for many people I never want to be part of that circus But he is obsessed with them Maybe my main issue is that I am not a royalist never lived in a Commonwealth country and dont really care about monarchies But I cant help but feel like Harry picked and choose when the firm institution or whatever you want to call it was at fault in his eyes It is only when it suited him In the end I feel sad for Caroline Flack and her family I feel sad for little boy Harry who lost his mom his world crumbled and he didnt get the love he craved I feel SAD because this wasnt the way to mend fences and heal This could be an influential book if he took responsibility for his actions This is not the truth This is his version of events Truth is somewhere in the middle and I guess  we never will know it because royals will not tell their side It must be hard to be born in an institution thousand years old with all the privileges that entail and then realize you are not all that special Because there are always a positive and negatives to any situation we found ourselves in Being privileged and rich doesnt exempt you from trauma and suffering but what is the point of explaining yourself to the press you so clearly hate and justifying your actions to the public who will form their own opinions anyway and who in the end buy the tabloids 15 This entire review has been hidden because of spoilersShow full review
Rating 5 out of 5,"It’s 2:14 am and I just finished reading Prince Harry’s memoir, SPARE. I said I’d write up a proper review, and here it is…First of all, I usually don’t read memoirs unless I’m interested in the person, or if it’s engaging, eye-opening, or just a good read. I decided to read SPARE because a) I wanted to draw my own conclusions, and b) because I genuinely believe that Prince Harry wouldn’t lie, and c) I wanted to see what was all the fuss about 🥴.I should start by saying I’m a fan of anything with the royal family, actually, ANY royal family - from other countries. And I was (and still am) a HUGE fan of Princess Diana. Her death was shocking, tragic, and her death was one of the very few celebrity deaths that made me cry. Now, overall SPARE was well-written, I could imagine Prince Harry telling his story, and it was fascinating, tragic, and eye-opening at the same time. For us royal fans we may think we know *everything* about the House of Windsor, but we clearly don’t. Through Prince Harry’s memoir we get a behind-the-scenes look into life as a royal, how uncharacteristically competitive this family can be, and - sadly - how they can backstab each other for better press coverage.I’ve heard from other readers how long the book was, and how “whiny” Prince Harry is, and that he and Meghan wanted “privacy” yet they did the interview with Oprah, they did the Netflix documentary, and now Harry wrote a memoir. I can understand how we - the public - can perceive this as them being hypocritical, but in essence they really wanted peace and quiet, and for the tabloid press to stop printing lies about them. Yes, they were interviewed by Oprah - but they wanted to speak their truth. Yes, they did the documentary, but they wanted to show us proof of what they endured and why they stepped back, and really how dangerous these paparazzis are. If I were in their shoes I’d do anything to tell the truth.There were some parts of the book that made me squirm and that was about his nether-regions being frost bitten - I thought that was a bit TMI. And the book could’ve been a lot shorter, maybe 50-100 pages less. But I guess Harry had a lot to say. One of the things that surprised me was the fact that William and Harry weren’t as close as we all believed. I mean, they grew up close, but not like I imagined them. It really is sad that royal life, and the role of the Heir and the Spare would put wedges between the two brothers. I also think it was sad for William to actually believe the lies about Meg - he shouldn’t let himself be brainwashed by his Comms staff, and the Bees. I think he should go to therapy himself, he has - it seems - so many unresolved issues and one of them is anger management. Like Harry says in the book - he has had fights and quarrels with his brother over the years, but the scene of William attacking Harry was - and is - not normal. People say that Harry is complaining about fighting with his brother, that everyone fights with their siblings. Yes. That could be true. But I never pushed my sister or one of my brothers to the ground, essentially breaking their necklace and making them to fall on the floor, etc. This isn’t normal behavior. This isn’t your typical sibling quarrels. This is physical violence. End of. And it’s scary that the future King can’t control his anger and is prone to losing his cool. I even wondered if he ever yelled at Kate. We shall never know.I truly hope that William and King Charles realize what Harry went through, that what the press has said about Meg (in his book he refers to Meghan as Meg) is all lies. And I truly hope that King Charles does away with the Royal Rota, once and for all, but I highly doubt it. I’m glad that Harry was able to speak his truth on his own terms even if there are many who refuse to believe him or give him the time of day. For those who have been following the British royal family I recommend reading Harry’s memoir; there’s no better book to get an honest, unfiltered view of what it’s like to be born as a royal prince, in the public eye, and whose family is unquestionably a hot mess of a dysfunctional family.Show more",5,Its 214 am and I just finished reading Prince Harrys memoir SPARE I said Id write up a proper review and here it isFirst of all I usually dont read memoirs unless Im interested in the person or if its engaging eyeopening or just a good read I decided to read SPARE because a I wanted to draw my own conclusions and b because I genuinely believe that Prince Harry wouldnt lie and c I wanted to see what was all the fuss about I should start by saying Im a fan of anything with the royal family actually ANY royal family  from other countries And I was and still am a HUGE fan of Princess Diana Her death was shocking tragic and her death was one of the very few celebrity deaths that made me cry Now overall SPARE was wellwritten I could imagine Prince Harry telling his story and it was fascinating tragic and eyeopening at the same time For us royal fans we may think we know everything about the House of Windsor but we clearly dont Through Prince Harrys memoir we get a behindthescenes look into life as a royal how uncharacteristically competitive this family can be and  sadly  how they can backstab each other for better press coverageIve heard from other readers how long the book was and how whiny Prince Harry is and that he and Meghan wanted privacy yet they did the interview with Oprah they did the Netflix documentary and now Harry wrote a memoir I can understand how we  the public  can perceive this as them being hypocritical but in essence they really wanted peace and quiet and for the tabloid press to stop printing lies about them Yes they were interviewed by Oprah  but they wanted to speak their truth Yes they did the documentary but they wanted to show us proof of what they endured and why they stepped back and really how dangerous these paparazzis are If I were in their shoes Id do anything to tell the truthThere were some parts of the book that made me squirm and that was about his netherregions being frost bitten  I thought that was a bit TMI And the book couldve been a lot shorter maybe 50100 pages less But I guess Harry had a lot to say One of the things that surprised me was the fact that William and Harry werent as close as we all believed I mean they grew up close but not like I imagined them It really is sad that royal life and the role of the Heir and the Spare would put wedges between the two brothers I also think it was sad for William to actually believe the lies about Meg  he shouldnt let himself be brainwashed by his Comms staff and the Bees I think he should go to therapy himself he has  it seems  so many unresolved issues and one of them is anger management Like Harry says in the book  he has had fights and quarrels with his brother over the years but the scene of William attacking Harry was  and is  not normal People say that Harry is complaining about fighting with his brother that everyone fights with their siblings Yes That could be true But I never pushed my sister or one of my brothers to the ground essentially breaking their necklace and making them to fall on the floor etc This isnt normal behavior This isnt your typical sibling quarrels This is physical violence End of And its scary that the future King cant control his anger and is prone to losing his cool I even wondered if he ever yelled at Kate We shall never knowI truly hope that William and King Charles realize what Harry went through that what the press has said about Meg in his book he refers to Meghan as Meg is all lies And I truly hope that King Charles does away with the Royal Rota once and for all but I highly doubt it Im glad that Harry was able to speak his truth on his own terms even if there are many who refuse to believe him or give him the time of day For those who have been following the British royal family I recommend reading Harrys memoir theres no better book to get an honest unfiltered view of what its like to be born as a royal prince in the public eye and whose family is unquestionably a hot mess of a dysfunctional familyShow more
Rating 2 out of 5,"I've finally finished the most hyped book of the year. I have so many thoughts and most of them are not positive, but let's start off positive. 1. This book ended my reading slump. I hadn't read anything in 10 days before picking this up. I stopped binge watching Grimm to read this book. 2. This man loves his wife. I've never felt more single in my whole life.Well, that's all the positives so now on to the negatives.1. This book is boring. Until we reached Part III and got to the Meghan years I was considering dnfing.2. This book is too long. Cut it in half and we have the same story. 3. He in my opinion wrote this book too soon. He's still in the middle of everything and he doesn't yet have a full grasp of the situation with his family. 4. Racism. This is the biggie..I know that the royal family is racist, so I wouldn't normally even bring it up because it's a given...but Harry states multiple times that he doesn't believe his family/ the monarchy are racist..?????Boy wtf is talking about? His bloodline is responsible for The Transatlantic Slave Trade. His family is responsible for the devastation of many many African nations. I'm coming at this from multiple perspectives1. I'm a Black American and I wouldn't even be here if European monarchies hadn't abducted my ancestors rape, beat, tortured and murdered them.2.My grandfather on my mother's side was from the Caribbean and we know the horrors that European monarchies unleashed on the Caribbean.3. I'm also Irish and Queen Victoria is responsible for the attempted genocide of the people of Ireland 4. I was raised Catholic...see #3 I've read and watched many things about the royal family and I tend to just keep the awful things that the royals have done in the back of my mind but I don't dwell on it. I love The Crown just like everyone else. And if Harry hadn't stated that his family wasn't racist I wouldn't have even mentioned it but he started this so I got call out his bloodline. At one point he tells the story of the British army's defeat of the Zulu nation and says that's why he loves the military...Really you love that the British invaded a country killed its men and raped and murdered its women and children??? Okay. At another point he's talking about a diamond his family ""owns"" and says people claim that it was stolen from India...Sweetheart all your families diamonds and other jewels are stolen from Brown and Black nations. If your family did the right thing and gave back all it's stolen wealth yall would be broke. He seems to think the only racists in Britain are the media and I have no doubt they are but 2 things can be true at the same time the press is racist and so is your family. Look I understand that the British press is feral and unhinged but he admits that his family works closely with them. So if the press is racist and your family works closely with them...what does that make your family? As I stated way back at the beginning of this unending review, Harry wrote this book too soon. He should have waited 5 to 10 years. When your in the middle of a journey you can't properly contextualize things. He is still too tied to his family. I think he went to easy on them. If they did the things that he's alluding to then he needs to sever all contact with them until they are ready to do better. He also needs to properly grieve his mother. He has alot of baggage and anger surrounding her death and he still hasn't dealt with that. Despite my disappointment with this book, I'm still rooting for Harry....well I'm rooting for Meghan but Harry's on her team so I support the team. And I would love to read a Meghan memoir, I think she'd give me the things that I felt this book lacked. I don't recommend this book, instead just watch his interviews instead.Show more",2,Ive finally finished the most hyped book of the year I have so many thoughts and most of them are not positive but lets start off positive 1 This book ended my reading slump I hadnt read anything in 10 days before picking this up I stopped binge watching Grimm to read this book 2 This man loves his wife Ive never felt more single in my whole lifeWell thats all the positives so now on to the negatives1 This book is boring Until we reached Part III and got to the Meghan years I was considering dnfing2 This book is too long Cut it in half and we have the same story 3 He in my opinion wrote this book too soon Hes still in the middle of everything and he doesnt yet have a full grasp of the situation with his family 4 Racism This is the biggieI know that the royal family is racist so I wouldnt normally even bring it up because its a givenbut Harry states multiple times that he doesnt believe his family the monarchy are racistBoy wtf is talking about His bloodline is responsible for The Transatlantic Slave Trade His family is responsible for the devastation of many many African nations Im coming at this from multiple perspectives1 Im a Black American and I wouldnt even be here if European monarchies hadnt abducted my ancestors rape beat tortured and murdered them2My grandfather on my mothers side was from the Caribbean and we know the horrors that European monarchies unleashed on the Caribbean3 Im also Irish and Queen Victoria is responsible for the attempted genocide of the people of Ireland 4 I was raised Catholicsee 3 Ive read and watched many things about the royal family and I tend to just keep the awful things that the royals have done in the back of my mind but I dont dwell on it I love The Crown just like everyone else And if Harry hadnt stated that his family wasnt racist I wouldnt have even mentioned it but he started this so I got call out his bloodline At one point he tells the story of the British armys defeat of the Zulu nation and says thats why he loves the militaryReally you love that the British invaded a country killed its men and raped and murdered its women and children Okay At another point hes talking about a diamond his family owns and says people claim that it was stolen from IndiaSweetheart all your families diamonds and other jewels are stolen from Brown and Black nations If your family did the right thing and gave back all its stolen wealth yall would be broke He seems to think the only racists in Britain are the media and I have no doubt they are but 2 things can be true at the same time the press is racist and so is your family Look I understand that the British press is feral and unhinged but he admits that his family works closely with them So if the press is racist and your family works closely with themwhat does that make your family As I stated way back at the beginning of this unending review Harry wrote this book too soon He should have waited 5 to 10 years When your in the middle of a journey you cant properly contextualize things He is still too tied to his family I think he went to easy on them If they did the things that hes alluding to then he needs to sever all contact with them until they are ready to do better He also needs to properly grieve his mother He has alot of baggage and anger surrounding her death and he still hasnt dealt with that Despite my disappointment with this book Im still rooting for Harrywell Im rooting for Meghan but Harrys on her team so I support the team And I would love to read a Meghan memoir I think shed give me the things that I felt this book lacked I dont recommend this book instead just watch his interviews insteadShow more

Rating 1 out of 5,"My emotions are complicated on this subject, naturally, but my bottom-line position isn’t. I’ll forever support my Queen, my Commander in Chief, my Granny. Even after she’s gone. My problem has never been with the monarchy, nor the concept of monarchy. It’s been with the press and the sick relationship that’s evolved between it and the Palace. I love my Mother Country, and I love my family, and I always will. I just wish, at the second-darkest moment of my life, they’d both been there for me.And I believe they’ll look back one day and wish they had too....How lost we are, I thought. How far we’ve strayed. How much damage has been done to our love, our bond, and why? All because a dreadful mob of dweebs and crones and cut-rate criminals and clinically diagnosable sadists along Fleet Street feel the need to get their jollies and plump their profits—and work out their personal issues—by tormenting one very large, very ancient, very dysfunctional family.According to AP, ‘Spare’ by Prince Harry sold over 3.2 million copies globally in a single week, meaning “it will likely rank among the bestselling memoirs of all time.” I suppose that leaves the Obamas in the dust. I wonder though how many people will actually read the book, or simply shelve it and forget about it. I also wonder if the phenomenal sales reflect genuine interest in and support for Harry and Meghan, or is it just an expression of schadenfreude at yet another scandal engulfing the Royal family?The Duke and Duchess of Sussex visited South Africa in September 2019, marking Archie’s first overseas trip. Harry also embarked on solo stints to Angola, Malawi and Botswana, which resulted in media reporting that the £246 000 jaunt was “the most expensive royal journey of 2019-2020, according to the royal financial records” (as reported by Sky News reporter Connor Sephton on 25 September 2020).Of course, this trip was the tipping point for the couple in their ongoing battle against the media, with Meghan launching legal action and Harry “deliver[ing] a scathing attack on the tabloid press while the tour was still under way.” It was also during this time that the ITV documentary was filmed.Africa, especially Botswana, has an almost spiritual connection for Harry, and this runs through ‘Spare’ like a golden thread. There is a complex, and uncomfortable, relationship between Britain and Africa to this day due to colonialism.At one point Harry comments that he had seen the movie ‘Zulu’ “countless times” and hence was particularly stoked when he got to visit the Rorke’s Drift battle site with Pa Charles. Marvelling at how 150 British soldiers held their own against 4 000 Zulus, you get a sense that this embodies everything Harry holds dear about British sang-froid.Harry is quick to point out, however, via his ghost writer: “Though a source of pride for many Britons, Rorke’s Drift was the outgrowth of imperialism, colonialism, nationalism – in short, theft.” This seems more like a footnote than a considered opinion though, and one can clearly imagine Harry visualising the tabloids as the marauding mass of Zulus against which he must make a stand on behalf of all civilisation (well, at least the Commonwealth). It is the kind of myopic self-centredness that is at the core of ‘Spare’, and which makes it so troubling as a supposed ‘memoir’.Speaking about colonialism, the infamous Nazi uniform incident in January 2005 was “a fancy-dress party, with a cringy theme. Natives and colonials. Guests were required to dress accordingly.” Harry claims he wanted to wear a British pilot’s uniform but settled on “a sand-coloured Nazi uniform. With a swastika armband. And a flat cap.” At the alleged instigation of Kate and William.This is one of the few revelations that pepper ‘Spare’, but to label it a ‘tell-all’ memoir as the media have branded it is to ignore the general tenor of the book, and Harry’s intent in having it published, which seems to be a genuine attempt to tell his side of the story, as it were. The fact that he cannot see beyond his own negative bias and privilege, however, inadvertently scuppers the book.The final section, about meeting Meghan and subsequent events, seems at once the most rushed and excruciating part, where Harry succumbs to an endless stream of recriminations and invective. Pity the poor ghost writer, who seems to have had so much fun with the earlier history bits, and now is totally lost as Harry gives vent to the biggest organ in his body, his spleen (no, it is not his todger, though that does enjoy its moment in the limelight).Show more",1,My emotions are complicated on this subject naturally but my bottomline position isnt Ill forever support my Queen my Commander in Chief my Granny Even after shes gone My problem has never been with the monarchy nor the concept of monarchy Its been with the press and the sick relationship thats evolved between it and the Palace I love my Mother Country and I love my family and I always will I just wish at the seconddarkest moment of my life theyd both been there for meAnd I believe theyll look back one day and wish they had tooHow lost we are I thought How far weve strayed How much damage has been done to our love our bond and why All because a dreadful mob of dweebs and crones and cutrate criminals and clinically diagnosable sadists along Fleet Street feel the need to get their jollies and plump their profitsand work out their personal issuesby tormenting one very large very ancient very dysfunctional familyAccording to AP Spare by Prince Harry sold over 32 million copies globally in a single week meaning it will likely rank among the bestselling memoirs of all time I suppose that leaves the Obamas in the dust I wonder though how many people will actually read the book or simply shelve it and forget about it I also wonder if the phenomenal sales reflect genuine interest in and support for Harry and Meghan or is it just an expression of schadenfreude at yet another scandal engulfing the Royal familyThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex visited South Africa in September 2019 marking Archies first overseas trip Harry also embarked on solo stints to Angola Malawi and Botswana which resulted in media reporting that the 246 000 jaunt was the most expensive royal journey of 20192020 according to the royal financial records as reported by Sky News reporter Connor Sephton on 25 September 2020Of course this trip was the tipping point for the couple in their ongoing battle against the media with Meghan launching legal action and Harry delivering a scathing attack on the tabloid press while the tour was still under way It was also during this time that the ITV documentary was filmedAfrica especially Botswana has an almost spiritual connection for Harry and this runs through Spare like a golden thread There is a complex and uncomfortable relationship between Britain and Africa to this day due to colonialismAt one point Harry comments that he had seen the movie Zulu countless times and hence was particularly stoked when he got to visit the Rorkes Drift battle site with Pa Charles Marvelling at how 150 British soldiers held their own against 4 000 Zulus you get a sense that this embodies everything Harry holds dear about British sangfroidHarry is quick to point out however via his ghost writer Though a source of pride for many Britons Rorkes Drift was the outgrowth of imperialism colonialism nationalism  in short theft This seems more like a footnote than a considered opinion though and one can clearly imagine Harry visualising the tabloids as the marauding mass of Zulus against which he must make a stand on behalf of all civilisation well at least the Commonwealth It is the kind of myopic selfcentredness that is at the core of Spare and which makes it so troubling as a supposed memoirSpeaking about colonialism the infamous Nazi uniform incident in January 2005 was a fancydress party with a cringy theme Natives and colonials Guests were required to dress accordingly Harry claims he wanted to wear a British pilots uniform but settled on a sandcoloured Nazi uniform With a swastika armband And a flat cap At the alleged instigation of Kate and WilliamThis is one of the few revelations that pepper Spare but to label it a tellall memoir as the media have branded it is to ignore the general tenor of the book and Harrys intent in having it published which seems to be a genuine attempt to tell his side of the story as it were The fact that he cannot see beyond his own negative bias and privilege however inadvertently scuppers the bookThe final section about meeting Meghan and subsequent events seems at once the most rushed and excruciating part where Harry succumbs to an endless stream of recriminations and invective Pity the poor ghost writer who seems to have had so much fun with the earlier history bits and now is totally lost as Harry gives vent to the biggest organ in his body his spleen no it is not his todger though that does enjoy its moment in the limelightShow more

The people who hate Meghan and, of course, Harry by default, are damning them because this is more proof of why they hate.

He had a Major traumatic experience as young boy. Of course, he had other familial trauma issues even before that. Just because the Royal Family or The Firm chooses to keep a “stiff upper lip” and sweep everything under the proverbial carpet doesn’t mean he has too! The title “Spare” has so many meanings. However, one of them means that he is NOT the King-in-waiting Prince. So, he’s leading his own life.

Rating 5 out of 5,"Time and again I’d see an expression cross Archie’s face and it would bring me up short. How much I wished my mother could hold her grandson, how often it happened that, while hugging Archie, I felt her—or wanted to.Spare is absolutely phenomenal. I’m sure the haters will pick it apart or just lie about what it says, so if you feel an affinity for this prince, read it yourself. The ghostwriter for the memoir renders Harry’s experiences in lyrical prose, almost poetic. Like many across the world, I’m a half orphan, and that was my initial connection with this man. Of course my loss of a parent wasn’t as traumatic or public, but it was so hard that adding those two factors and surviving feels positively superhuman.As I read this book, I found myself thinking of his mother, not due to my experience as a child who has lost a parent, but as a parent myself. Thinking of my youngest and knowing that any part of Harry’s mother’s spirit that lives on is sending all her strength and love to him. But make no mistake, if you are the mother of a son, this is a difficult book, especially if you’ve lost a parent.Now, a few sections that spoke to me the most:Maybe the universe delays what it disapproves of? When the wedding did finally take place—without Granny, who chose not to attend—it was almost cathartic for everyone, even me.Both Harry and “Willy” asked their Pa not to marry Camilla and yet he did anyway. That backstory is well known so I won’t retread. But this particular junction is pivotal to what Harry believes caused the press to target him—rehabilitating Camilla’s reputation as the other woman who caused Princess Diana so much grief—and kept the stories going out of the then Wales (now Monarch’s) press shop.There was so much to say, we had so much in common, though we came from such different worlds.Prince Harry is open about a handful of girlfriends, and then he gets to meeting Meghan. This story is somehow so relatable and yet deeply romantic. He shares who Meghan truly is and it’s so obviously true love. Makes what came next so hard to read. A month earlier Meg and I had done an interview with Oprah Winfrey. (Days before it aired, those Meg-is-a-bully stories started popping up in the papers—what a coincidence!)The trauma of the BRF and what they do to Prince Harry is so enormously effed up it may leave you breathless. His memoir makes clear that while he had a support system that included surrogate parents, the hole in his heart has never been healed. What was a bit of a surprise was despite his grandmother being Queen Elizabeth II and the reigning monarch, the love she continued to give him from afar was critical in his life. He speaks of her death and their final conversation. It’s clear that despite the no hugging rule, she did mean the world to him.Show more",5,Time and again Id see an expression cross Archies face and it would bring me up short How much I wished my mother could hold her grandson how often it happened that while hugging Archie I felt heror wanted toSpare is absolutely phenomenal Im sure the haters will pick it apart or just lie about what it says so if you feel an affinity for this prince read it yourself The ghostwriter for the memoir renders Harrys experiences in lyrical prose almost poetic Like many across the world Im a half orphan and that was my initial connection with this man Of course my loss of a parent wasnt as traumatic or public but it was so hard that adding those two factors and surviving feels positively superhumanAs I read this book I found myself thinking of his mother not due to my experience as a child who has lost a parent but as a parent myself Thinking of my youngest and knowing that any part of Harrys mothers spirit that lives on is sending all her strength and love to him But make no mistake if you are the mother of a son this is a difficult book especially if youve lost a parentNow a few sections that spoke to me the mostMaybe the universe delays what it disapproves of When the wedding did finally take placewithout Granny who chose not to attendit was almost cathartic for everyone even meBoth Harry and Willy asked their Pa not to marry Camilla and yet he did anyway That backstory is well known so I wont retread But this particular junction is pivotal to what Harry believes caused the press to target himrehabilitating Camillas reputation as the other woman who caused Princess Diana so much griefand kept the stories going out of the then Wales now Monarchs press shopThere was so much to say we had so much in common though we came from such different worldsPrince Harry is open about a handful of girlfriends and then he gets to meeting Meghan This story is somehow so relatable and yet deeply romantic He shares who Meghan truly is and its so obviously true love Makes what came next so hard to read A month earlier Meg and I had done an interview with Oprah Winfrey Days before it aired those Megisabully stories started popping up in the paperswhat a coincidenceThe trauma of the BRF and what they do to Prince Harry is so enormously effed up it may leave you breathless His memoir makes clear that while he had a support system that included surrogate parents the hole in his heart has never been healed What was a bit of a surprise was despite his grandmother being Queen Elizabeth II and the reigning monarch the love she continued to give him from afar was critical in his life He speaks of her death and their final conversation Its clear that despite the no hugging rule she did mean the world to himShow more

Rating 5 out of 5,"Actual rating: 9/10Here's the thing: I admittedly do not hold this family as close to my heart as many of the world does. I potentially have less bias towards them because I was never exposed to overt interest in them over here in the US. Princess Diana was, of course, a fashion icon and beloved by many. Her death sent spirals across the world. The most I knew about the Windsor family pertained to her. She's was this magnetic force only witnessed rarely within this world. I know that much of the world views this entire family as an extension of their own; they love and hate them with as much vigor, if not more, than their own families. I get that I'm just a lowly American and don't fully understand what the Royal Family means to others... and yet, I'm going to share my review anyway.This is well-written and I know that Harry used a ghostwriter, but his memories are presented beautifully. Harry is humble about his abilities and his intelligence. I think he’s much smarter and talented than he gives himself credit for or has been made to believe, but he probably felt the act of writing the book himself is out of his league. That doesn't mean his story is any less worthwhile. I listened to the audiobook and Harry's voice gives the words a wonderful emotional range. You can tell he cares about this book and how things are presented. I've heard over and over how much of a spoiled brat Harry is for writing this book. If he wasn't a Royal, I'd read this book and think, ""wow, this is a man who so deeply needed to speak into existence the emotional (and sometimes physical) trauma he experienced."" There is such deep love for his family in this book, even though there's admonishment. Who hasn't had a love/hate relationship with people in their families? If you haven't, you're lucky. It seems for centuries we have expected anyone with 'royal blood' to shut up and do what they are told. That seems to be a completely unfair expectation. The person who speaks up about misdeeds within a cemented part of society are rarely looked on kindly at the time, although history often looks upon them with a much fonder, less biased view. Like I said, Harry speaks lovingly of every single member of his family. He talks about the intense trauma of losing his mother that has never gone away. He talks about his time in the military, extensively. He talks about the PTSD that both those experiences left him with. He talks about his experiences with therapy and how intrinsic it was to his healing. Yes, he talks about physical altercations. Really, so much of it is a recapping of his life with side commentary about his family. The portion of the book that dives into his experiences with Meghan don't really take up that much of the book. Rather, it brings it together at the end to highlight who the real enemy has been throughout this: the British tabloids. The media has haunted him in such complete circle throughout his life. They've traumatized him. And his family often fed into it, whether by fueling the flames or ignoring them entirely.This is was a revelatory memoir and I really enjoyed it. Harry doesn't hold back from his own misdeeds or flaws. The only reason I didn't rate it the full 10/10 was because I got a bit distracted as his time in the military was a huge portion of this story. My mind tends to stray during war talk. For others, this will portion will be a major draw.Show more",5,Actual rating 910Heres the thing I admittedly do not hold this family as close to my heart as many of the world does I potentially have less bias towards them because I was never exposed to overt interest in them over here in the US Princess Diana was of course a fashion icon and beloved by many Her death sent spirals across the world The most I knew about the Windsor family pertained to her Shes was this magnetic force only witnessed rarely within this world I know that much of the world views this entire family as an extension of their own they love and hate them with as much vigor if not more than their own families I get that Im just a lowly American and dont fully understand what the Royal Family means to others and yet Im going to share my review anywayThis is wellwritten and I know that Harry used a ghostwriter but his memories are presented beautifully Harry is humble about his abilities and his intelligence I think hes much smarter and talented than he gives himself credit for or has been made to believe but he probably felt the act of writing the book himself is out of his league That doesnt mean his story is any less worthwhile I listened to the audiobook and Harrys voice gives the words a wonderful emotional range You can tell he cares about this book and how things are presented Ive heard over and over how much of a spoiled brat Harry is for writing this book If he wasnt a Royal Id read this book and think wow this is a man who so deeply needed to speak into existence the emotional and sometimes physical trauma he experienced There is such deep love for his family in this book even though theres admonishment Who hasnt had a lovehate relationship with people in their families If you havent youre lucky It seems for centuries we have expected anyone with royal blood to shut up and do what they are told That seems to be a completely unfair expectation The person who speaks up about misdeeds within a cemented part of society are rarely looked on kindly at the time although history often looks upon them with a much fonder less biased view Like I said Harry speaks lovingly of every single member of his family He talks about the intense trauma of losing his mother that has never gone away He talks about his time in the military extensively He talks about the PTSD that both those experiences left him with He talks about his experiences with therapy and how intrinsic it was to his healing Yes he talks about physical altercations Really so much of it is a recapping of his life with side commentary about his family The portion of the book that dives into his experiences with Meghan dont really take up that much of the book Rather it brings it together at the end to highlight who the real enemy has been throughout this the British tabloids The media has haunted him in such complete circle throughout his life Theyve traumatized him And his family often fed into it whether by fueling the flames or ignoring them entirelyThis is was a revelatory memoir and I really enjoyed it Harry doesnt hold back from his own misdeeds or flaws The only reason I didnt rate it the full 1010 was because I got a bit distracted as his time in the military was a huge portion of this story My mind tends to stray during war talk For others this will portion will be a major drawShow more
Rating 5 out of 5,"I guess I shouldn’t be surprised at the disdainful or even vitriolic reviews of this book in all the UK press. But I am. Clearly, Harry’s views threaten and upset people because he shows, heartbreakingly, how useless and corrupt the monarchy really is. How can anyone want them as symbols of the country when so much of their efforts are to desperately maintain wealth and power by servicing vile media moguls like Murdoch? We see royals throwing their own relatives under the bus, condoning and even manufacturing countless lies to elevate themselves. Awful.It was also a relief to hear him speak of the profound damage that childhood neglect does to a person, especially when it’s compounded by complex trauma and PTSD. I watched the Oprah and Harry documentary on trauma on AppleTV and Harry and Meghan on Netflix and had already come to appreciate their integrity and concern for others. This book gave me insight though into how painfully lonely Harry’s life was until he met Meghan and what a difference it makes when someone really loves you and will fight your corner, what happens when you refuse to perpetuate a corrupt system.The press should be using this book to ask whether we need a monarchy at all (no,from my point of view) rather than venting their contempt. I hope this leads many to ask that question.Show more",5,I guess I shouldnt be surprised at the disdainful or even vitriolic reviews of this book in all the UK press But I am Clearly Harrys views threaten and upset people because he shows heartbreakingly how useless and corrupt the monarchy really is How can anyone want them as symbols of the country when so much of their efforts are to desperately maintain wealth and power by servicing vile media moguls like Murdoch We see royals throwing their own relatives under the bus condoning and even manufacturing countless lies to elevate themselves AwfulIt was also a relief to hear him speak of the profound damage that childhood neglect does to a person especially when its compounded by complex trauma and PTSD I watched the Oprah and Harry documentary on trauma on AppleTV and Harry and Meghan on Netflix and had already come to appreciate their integrity and concern for others This book gave me insight though into how painfully lonely Harrys life was until he met Meghan and what a difference it makes when someone really loves you and will fight your corner what happens when you refuse to perpetuate a corrupt systemThe press should be using this book to ask whether we need a monarchy at all nofrom my point of view rather than venting their contempt I hope this leads many to ask that questionShow more
Rating 3 out of 5,"The thing is is that this book either hurt my heart or seriously bored me to tears. 1. I just know too much about Harry's penis now2. My heart hurts for both Harry and William for losing their mom as such vulnerable ages and not being shown any sort of love or compassion. (probably should have started with this as #1 lol)3. My heart hurts knowing that they both grieved on their own and not together4. I just didn't care enough about his army days. BORE5. I knew all the highlights of the book from 60 minutesThere are more points but I am not going to focus on them. I will say I remember the day Princess Diana died, I watched her funeral with the rest of the world, but after that I just didn't pay too much attention to the royal family. I don't remember most of the headlines of Harry being dumb or Harry dressed as a nazi or Harry the druggie. I like majority of the world did wake up to watch William and Kate get married and then woke up again to watch Harry marry Meghan.Avid twitter junkie (me) remembers seeing the North American world explode about William cheating on Kate and I read all that juicy gossip like a fiend, discussed it with my friend at work. All the talk about Meaghan. All the he said she said. You would have to be dead or a hermit to not see it, hear it, read it.... Listen we all are fascinated bc they are royal and blah blah blah but at the end of the day they are just really dysfunctional humans that are thrust at us everyday bc its sensational and the average human foams at the mouth for it.Whether you are team Harry or Team RP (William/Charles) I really don't think there are any winners in this whole sad saga. And thats really it, its all really just a sad state of affairs....PS Cant wait for where The Crown is gonna go with all this!

Rating 5 out of 5,"4.5. Spare is honest and genuine and told with such love and understanding, all underwritten with an immense amount of pain, that I did in fact almost cry in the last sections of part three. I think it's about time Harry expressed his side of the story, and his side is about trauma, unresolved pain, the ghost of his mother and a fractured concept of brotherhood that neither he nor William can seem to patch together. I have a lot of respect for Harry and a lot of respect for his story. It's told eloquently, clearly, and with love for everyone he cares about. I hope this is the thing to mend the cracks in that truly dysfunctional family, but I doubt it would be so simple. I also love that every ""shocking"" reveal actually ends up rather mundane.

Rating 4 out of 5,"I have lots of thoughts and feelings about this book. First off, if anyone trolls this review in the comments I am blocking and deleting comments because it’s not that deep. I’ve never been a royalist, I’ve never been a fan of the monarchy. I never understood as an American why I should care about these people, especially when for a long time they were enforcing modern day colonialism. But with all the hate Meghan Markle gets over the years, it enrages me how her and Harry are treated by the press and the public. So I wanted to read from Harry’s own words his side of the story. The amount of hate Harry and Meghan gets astounds me. And what drives me wild is when people who don’t listen to the interviews, who don’t read the book or they take quotes out of context, they are always the loudest opposers or criticizers. And often, they’ll say “H or M need to do this!” without realizing, they already have or are. So my two cents is: actually do your research before making comments because most of the time you sound like an idiot to those who have already educated themselves. This book isn’t as salacious as the media makes it out to be. What stood out to me the most about this book was the story of a young boy whose mother was taken away from him at a too young age and the circumstances around that are wildly unconventional. My heart breaks for both Harry and William for them losing their mother at a young age and having to publicly deal with that.  Another thing about this book, a lot of it was about Harry’s military career, which didn’t really interest me. I am glad he’s proud of it, as he should be, but a large portion of this book was about it and wasn’t interesting to me.  As for the dynamics between Harry and William, I see both sides on a lot of things. Sibling dynamics are already complicated, and then you add in becoming king or being a spare and that really just sort of creates chaos. Harry talked a lot about how William didn’t want to talk to him at school and while that sucks, isn’t that something very normal that happens with older and younger siblings? I’m not sure Harry had the perspective of seeing other families go through the same thing. .  I felt Harry could have been a lot meaner when it came to his family. I read this book as he was presenting his side of the story and his facts when lies had been promoted about him for years. I can understand wanting to address wrongful misinformation being spread about oneself. I am sure that’s incredibly frustrating for the entire family.Show more",4,I have lots of thoughts and feelings about this book First off if anyone trolls this review in the comments I am blocking and deleting comments because its not that deep Ive never been a royalist Ive never been a fan of the monarchy I never understood as an American why I should care about these people especially when for a long time they were enforcing modern day colonialism But with all the hate Meghan Markle gets over the years it enrages me how her and Harry are treated by the press and the public So I wanted to read from Harrys own words his side of the story The amount of hate Harry and Meghan gets astounds me And what drives me wild is when people who dont listen to the interviews who dont read the book or they take quotes out of context they are always the loudest opposers or criticizers And often theyll say H or M need to do this without realizing they already have or are So my two cents is actually do your research before making comments because most of the time you sound like an idiot to those who have already educated themselves This book isnt as salacious as the media makes it out to be What stood out to me the most about this book was the story of a young boy whose mother was taken away from him at a too young age and the circumstances around that are wildly unconventional My heart breaks for both Harry and William for them losing their mother at a young age and having to publicly deal with that  Another thing about this book a lot of it was about Harrys military career which didnt really interest me I am glad hes proud of it as he should be but a large portion of this book was about it and wasnt interesting to me  As for the dynamics between Harry and William I see both sides on a lot of things Sibling dynamics are already complicated and then you add in becoming king or being a spare and that really just sort of creates chaos Harry talked a lot about how William didnt want to talk to him at school and while that sucks isnt that something very normal that happens with older and younger siblings Im not sure Harry had the perspective of seeing other families go through the same thing   I felt Harry could have been a lot meaner when it came to his family I read this book as he was presenting his side of the story and his facts when lies had been promoted about him for years I can understand wanting to address wrongful misinformation being spread about oneself I am sure thats incredibly frustrating for the entire familyShow more
Rating 5 out of 5,"I have chosen an Audio version of the book on Audible, which cost me one credit. It was the right choice. I enjoyed listening to Spare written by Prince Harry and narrated by the author, which became my favourite page-turner or binge-listening. Before I started listening to this book I have read several reviews that put me down about this book. However, it was all a pleasure hearing true Royal stories from a Royal person. Here Harry starts from a young age by telling how it was at school, his relationship with his brother William and his wife Kate, and later, about his Army timePrince Harry's voice speaks to tell his own story about life. Prince Harry speaks about his mother Diana's death and how he dealt with what happened after he went after his mother's coffin. He tried hard to protect his New Family, being afraid history repeats itself as it happened to Princess Diana and her friend. The young family had to run down. How difficult it was when The British yellow press was making up stories and was full of aggression towards the new Duchess who was pregnant at that time. I feel huge respect for Harry and Megan. With sympathy, l couldn't understand why British people choose to act in this way towards their Royalty. Probably, I will never know as I am from Republic. Nonetheless, it was great listening.

And most bizarre of all his infamous dressing up as a nazi he now blames on his family. For the author it's always someone else's fault.

Rating 3 out of 5,"OPEN LETTER TO HARRY:Hi Harry. I'm Belle. You suffered a childhood trauma when you lost your mother and I also suffered a similar trauma when I lost my father in those very difficult ages between 9-12. What you suffered next was the neglect of a rich parent. I suffered the neglect of an impoverished parent. What I've learned from this book is that it was neglect all the same. I'm telling you this very personal thing because I am older than you and I am seeing the very painful path that you are on. Consider this one idea for a course correction.1. Forgive your Pa, Harry. For everything. His neglect. His inability to parent. His marriage to Camilla - the love of his life. Forgive him even if he is guilty of planting items in the press for his own good. It is clear you have a Pa size hole in your heart and I bet your Pa has a similar sized hole in his heart. Be the bridge. Do not be the fire. Fire is death and destruction. Your most intimate stories in this book tell of a man - you - that is gentle and loving. 2. Yep - forgive Willy and Kate. Willy also had trauma. He is handling it differently than you. Nonetheless he must also handle it in his own way. You must give him permission to do this because you also are doing that. Hop on a commercial plane with Archie. Bring him to Balmoral or wherever you all hang out now. Leave Meghan at home - just for now. Build your relationship with your brother through your children. Forgive him and erase those dang texts that you are saving with angry words. Never keep angry words stored by people that you love. You will never be able to get over those words if you re-read them. Just meet Willy where he is at and stop demanding an immediate fix to a problem that both of you hold blame for. Put down the swords. When you are in your 50s and 60s it may well be too late to solve these problems. Tackle them now. There is a Harold sized hole in his heart. You can fill it. 3. Do not force a relationship between Kate and Meghan. That would be ridiculous. The bridesmaid dresses, the lip gloss is all water under the bridge. Kate has not been raised ""American"" and Meghan should not treat her as such. If a relationship is to be built, it will be long after you re-establish a relationship with your brother. Meghan is on her own with Kate. 4. Last - get over this crud about being the SPARE. This is the most ridiculous title for your memoir. You are ""cutting yourself"" over and over with this title and this thought. How about if you consider yourself SPARE-D?? By God, Harry, you have been given the great, great gift of freedom that your brother will never experience. Live your freedom and rejoice in it. Go earn a living and love those children and wife with everything you have. This is your gift. Do not give it back like a spoiled child. 5. I think, ultimately, if you can find a way to make yourself as small as possible in this world and just observe you will see what I am talking about. Right now, your face is taking up the whole screen and you are too big in your own head. For example, other than you bringing it up again in this book, no one was really going to remember the strip poker in Las Vegas or needed to know about your frozen penis or so many other examples when you have felt too large for the world. The collective memory is really rather small and you just need to let it fade. 6. You need to up your coping skills. You are allowing yourself to be too fragile. Learn to cope with the life you have been given - all of it.Love, BelleIt's getting a 3 because I recognize that Harry did pour his soul into this book. His effort is there. If I was rating this just for me it would be a 2. This book SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN WRITTEN. It's a money grab to support his family and pay for his security.

Rating 3 out of 5,"Spare.Spare part? Maybe.Spare as in supporting who goes before you? Maybe.Most of us know the lineage and how the Royalty goes. And no one can change where they come in that line of birth, only circumstances. No matter where you want to be within your family peers, it is what it is, unless there are circumstances or tragedies to change that.I went into this trying to keep any judgements any reviews, anything I’ve heard……away.I wanted to read this on its merit.We all know there are skeletons in families closets, secrets, lies, untold stories and it’s also in this Royal family, and far worse. So my thoughts were……masses (the Firm) against one? Did I remain with that thought……Let’s see….Harry says he was “bored” by his families history. He obviously wasn’t interested.His lack of empathy shone through and the “poor me” wanting empathy came through.He has his “side” and he speaks “his truth”.We all have our truths, it’s not necessarily THE truth, but it’s THAT persons truth to how they’ve internalised it, interpreted it. But it doesn’t make it truthFUL.We can’t question that, just read, listen and observe.There are lots spoken in here as Truths however, he also admits that he can’t remember ? I’m thinking, I have memories and I’m 64. But are they MY memories or what others have told me or I’ve heard? Have I put my own spin on them? Probably! More so today, you can Google anything and he’s not blind, he’s watched things online, interviews, You Tube, recordings, papers etc etc about his Mom. I have no doubt, no doubt at all that the loss of his Mom plays an important part in his memory and his life now.I can’t help but hear him on and on about media, his Mom hounded, camera flashes, intruding on every aspect of her life, he’s read that, he’s seen that online I’m sure. Has that impacted so much he couldn’t save his Mom so he’s reverting this onto “saving Meghan and his children” because he feels…..and he knows the impact on his younger years? Who knows.It’s a big problem. But William and Kate handle the paparazzi, they’ve set boundaries. I’m not going into…..is Meghan to blame.All children aren’t the same, and parents mostly know this, right?So you can’t expect one to react the same either.Maybe he needed more help. He needed them to talk about his Mom in the family, to keep her alive, he suggests this wasn’t the case.Recalling all this now he’s obviously internalised his anger, loss, frustration, hurt and yes hate. He eludes many times to how he felt “left out”.Did Harry and William turn the grief towards each other?He’s pretty messed up, this would definitely make him out to be a liar. Deliberate or unfunctionable? Again, who knows.I read this trying to understand his mental mindset. Is he making trouble? Or does he want changes? Either way, he’s done it the wrong way, big time.Has he been burying his emotions? Does having children now change his outlook on his life?He had story after story, marginalising people and himself.He’s not humble. To me it’s like him using things in the book to prove he’s a nice kind person, yet, doing something like this. There are many discrepancies.As humans we excuse ourselves yet find it hard to excuse others.William and Harry lost their Mom.And each will have different ways of managing that grief. Each will process it differently.As a man today, I feel that many things have clouded his vision. Maybe what he’s heard, been told or read.The lowdown on certain things in this book, situations he found himself, if he felt that way, he should have spoken up and dealt with it. Whether something was done or not, it’s filed the way it should be and not publicly.Are his family insensitive? Or were certain things not thought through? The impact some decisions have on Harry I cannot think that this man is over sensitive. Nothing wrong in that but it does lead a person to self doubt and troubled overthinking to others motives (if any).It’s a right Royal mess, I can say that much! He seems very troubled.People aren’t daft.The saying is “ don’t hang your dirty washing out in public”. I’m glad I read this because when folk talk about it I have a clearer understanding of my own thoughts.I don’t believe I can have an opinion on things unless I know myself, and I read and take on board others opinions and that in itself makes me think. In the end I find that this man is either aimed in making trouble or HE is very troubled.There’s lies, contradictory and his tongue has been on fire with all his thoughts had “his truths” that cannot be relied on.I may have overthought this book and excuse me if I have.

Rating 4 out of 5,"Spare is divided into three parts: childhood, military, and Meghan. I got a little bored during the middle — there was a bit too much about his time in the military, but it did have some interesting parts. My favorite part was the third, which upped my rating from three to four stars. He gave a lot of behind the scenes info about what was really going on behind the cameras, which I found fascinating. The epilogue is about the queen’s death. If you’re interested in the royals and Harry and Meghan’s story, it’s definitely worth the read. I loved all the details about their relationship — some of which was in the Netflix documentary and some new things too. If you’re not a fan and hate him/Meghan and are reading it for the hype, you will be disappointed and probably hate the book, so just save yourself the time.

Rating 1 out of 5,"Cringeworthy. It’s obvious that the psychedelics did him no good at all. I just finished Michael Pollan’s “How to change your mind” and I had high hopes from a person like Prince Harry who has taken shrooms consistently from early in his life. PH comes across as entitled and clueless. I don’t understand why his ghostwriter didn’t present him in a better light. The parts about his pain on losing his mother are very moving and well written but it goes awry after that. The book’s style is inconsistent, giving the vibe that it has been written by several authors, of uneven quality and dubious intentions. I skipped many uncomfortable/boring parts (for instance, re his private parts or salacious encounters).I feel that memoirs should have a wise, uplifting, thought-provoking underlying message.

Rating 5 out of 5,"4.5 stars rounded up.I'm not sure what I went into Spare expecting, but it exceeded my expectations. From my understanding, Prince Harry had a ghostwriter that helped him achieve this, but it was obvious to me that he had a lot to do with the creation and writing of this memoir. It was beautifully and lyrically written, dripping with gorgeous detail, while also feeling like it was coming from a place of genuine love for his family and even the institution that he was raised in. This memoir didn't feel like a tell-all, but rather a poignant picture of a life left wanting for love and acceptance, peace and freedom.Harry thoughtfully discusses grief, mental health, PTSD, family dynamics, and daily struggles that--although growing up royal--the average reader could probably relate to on some level. The title of this memoir, heartbreakingly coined Spare, is meant in the way that it was perceived by me and is a recurring theme for better or for worse. He navigates the way this word, this title, has permeated his life and the things he has and has not been allowed to accomplish. How it has made him both freer to make some choices while also burdening him with a heavier load, particularly when it comes to the press, which is a recurring topic he discusses. I think, at his core, this is a plea for the British press (and press in general) to stop approaching people's lives like a warfront. The astonishing parallel he makes to the dehumanizing of him and his family to the ways he was trained to operate in the military was chilling and eye-opening.If I had any critiques, I initially thought it was going to rest in his giving details about his past relationships (really, one of the only parts that made it feel like a ""tell-all""), but a friend made the point that this was likely done to highlight how much different his partnership with Meghan has been. And, I definitely think that's the case. Yes, he discusses frostbite on . . . an appendage . . . and while that is certainly more detail than I think anyone needed to know or read about, it's minor in the scheme of what he says within the bigger picture of this memoir. His discussion on war, in particular, was interesting to me as someone who has had a lot of family in the military. He recognizes the purpose it gave his life when he was in need of direction while also pointing out its damaging aftermath and how it has negatively affected so many people.Harry clearly needed to do this. It seemed cathartic and necessary for him to clear up his story and side of things, and to protect his family from the vitriol they've received in the last few years. I commend him, and I still stand by being proud of the brave choice he made of leaving the crown behind to make the decisions that were best for him and his family.

Rating 3 out of 5,"This is quite a hard one to give a star rating to. How do I rate/separate the enjoyment or otherwise of the book against the content/thoughts about whether content is true/correct to say/should be included etc.So I sat on the fence with three stars.One quote from the book sums up this book for me. About 25% of the way through and he is talking about the book Diana’s butler wrote after her death that was billed as telling her true story and it didn’t go down well with the Royal family. He writes this, with no sense of irony, reflection or self-awareness: “Mummy’s former butler had penned a tell-all which actually told nothing. It was merely one man’s self-justifying, self-centring version of events.” And that is what you are going to get throughout. I can't understand why the press hasn't picked up on that one about his own book!!!I also feel the need to say I am British, I like the Royal Family and the Monarchy. Wouldn't say I am a Royalist but I like the concept and the people including Harry and Meghan. Was so pleased he seemed to have found someone he can build a family with, and I object strongly to lots of the stories and the way Meghan has been portrayed in our press and they do not do it in my name. So I am not in the camp of they all must burn - honestly it seems so entrenched, it is like staunch remainers and staunch leavers arguing Brexit, no-one is going to listen to the other. And that is a huge problem with the issue of Harry and Meghan leaving as senior royals and why they and the family cannot work it through I think.At times it reads like a Victorian melodrama dripping with over the top metaphors. At times it reads like a pity party, poor me, I don't want to be Spare, (he doesn't quite say this next one but it is implied I think) I think I should be King, who would want to be King? He seems like a man who thinks his whole or 90% of his reason for existence is to be a Spare. I agree part of his existence is due to that but not all of it and not him as a person, they love him, he is loved, he has repeatedly talked about his excellent relationship with the Queen and the Queen Mother, and the family generally. He is part of a great line and history (which at times he boasts about) but from what else he says here and elsewhere he clearly is not just seen as a Spare. At one point he actually says ""My family had declared me a nullity."" In my view, no they hadn't, he worked himself up so much about it that it was true in his head. He seems capable of ignoring everything positive about his life, his family, his role, his opportunities and focuses entirely on the negatives. It all comes across as a massive chip on his shoulder and he will never let himself get over it and lets it taint his entire life.He is a man who clearly will hold a grudge forever and perhaps that is why he and the Royal Family cannot move forward, how many times did he feel the need to refer to the odd biro he got as a Christmas present from Princess Margaret? Honestly, it felt like he was looking for reasons to need a pen throughout the book just so he could refer to it, on and on. Admittedly an odd present but I have long seen stories that as the Royal Family have rather a lot of stuff, they aim to buy each other weird and odd Christmas presents, so maybe just that? But he holds a grudge long long after the event and Princess Margaret's death. Is it worth a 20 plus year grudge and a recurring theme in your autobiography? No!!!And the whole book feels like that, he has a massive chip on his shoulder and this book is his chance for a massive whinge. So by the time you get to the big problem of the press and Meghan, your head is so bored of the moaning and lack of self awareness, this section which should be serious, is just dull and tiresome and you don't want any more. There are clearly issues with the British press and perhaps other countries, and how his family have and haven't reacted, and the sheer volume and relentlessness of it is tough to read and even tougher I imagine to be the subject of and read daily, but some of the stories he mentions are so minor yet he wants a response to each and every one which isn't practical. He openly admits he reads every one to keep Meghan ""safe"" whilst then cross examining her about the truth of each one in the early days of their relationship. Did he think that would be helpful to her and his mental health? His approach to it - and I think the grudge holding - is a huge part of the problem. He needs to get past this or he will self-destruct completely, more than he clearly has at times past. And he is a man who has never made peace with the death of his mother. So so hard to do but his approach clearly hasn't worked and it has added to his issues. I do hope he can manage to find a peace with it as her absence and his loss drips from the pages and again it negatively taints his entire outlook.On one hand my heart bleeds for this poor child/teenager/man who has suffered so much, but on the other hand, I just want to get him by the shoulders, shake him and say look what your head is doing to yourself!!!So it is really hard to separate the content from the style. I was willing the end to come for about 100 pages (which is around where the issues with the press and Meghan start), it was so relentless for a range of reasons yet his take on it is repetitive and boring to be frank. And he seemingly can't see or take responsibility for his role in things. He behaves like a terribly naughty child/teenager at school and in home life, giving us detail of how he misbehaves, is horrible to the teachers and then moans he is seen as the ""naughty one"". This might feel a petty thing for me to pull out but oh, it is indicative of the whole book and it is tiresome! Like a lot of the interviews he and Meghan have given recently he doesn't seem to have any self reflection or awareness of his role in what happens in his life. And for someone who cares so much about privacy of him and his family, the stories he includes breaching his family, friends and past girlfriend's privacy is staggering.And so, he says it best himself.

Rating 3 out of 5,"I personally have found both Harry and Meghan exhausting. But whether you like Harry or not, this man is suffering a pain we all do not understand. It is easy to judge a person on how one acts and copes with the loss of a parent when they're a child. But I would rather not judge his story. We all have a story, we all make mistakes, we all have family fights, we all have suffered loss. And to be quite frank, everyone deserves to be heard. To me, this book very much reveals that William and Harry seem to be still grieving over their mother Diana and unfortunately their relationship is being pulled apart by the very tradition which made their own mother miserable enough to leave. It was hard to read this book. I truly hope William and Harry can both heal and reunite as brothers.

Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5⭐️Written with a top notch ghost writer, this was an exceptionally written memoir. Prince Harry goes into intimate chronological detail of his life to date. From his early school days, Diana’s death, his foray into the military, and of course his life with Meghan. Now, the dirt. Was it as dishy as I expected it to be? Not really. A lot of the media leaks sensationalized some of the content, and while some topics were pretty cringe (🍆), I didn’t find there were really any incredibly juicy moments. Yet, I was still fascinated at seeing an insider look at royal life. Fairly early in the book he discusses his mother’s death and how his “Pa” broke the news to him and Will of Diana’s passing. Harry discusses how he suppressed his grief until well into adulthood, and only ever cried for his mother once. He coped for several years by convincing himself his mum wasn’t actually dead, but in hiding somewhere, and that she would eventually return to him and his brother. Heartbreaking. Various disputes that were mentioned involving either his brother or father were very much one sided, and felt more like a ploy for sympathy for him. However, you can’t pass judgement on all parties involved when you don’t get to hear from both sides. Harry does mention more than once that his memory is spotty, and so I think you have to especially take what he says with a grain of salt. Now, if you’re here for the Meghan related drama, she isn’t introduced in the book until 2/3 in. Some of what he discussed about their relationship is rehashed from their recent documentary, which I found to be both insightful and grating. Absolutely the British press was horrible to them, and the racism towards Meghan was shocking, so I can understand their wish to escape the monarchy, but perhaps not the way they went about it. I really enjoyed listening to Harry narrate his own story, but ultimately this book left me feeling quite sad. For both him and his family. He still very much carries a brokenness stemming from his mother’s death, and growing up in an unusual family with little emotional support. It seems he has found what he seeks in a solid family unit with Meghan, but at a great cost. I question what Harry has achieved by penning his own narrative and airing the family dirty laundry and if he will feel satisfied. I’d say it’s safe to say that he has severed any hopes of reconciliation with his family which is tragic. Glad I read this one and would highly recommend.

Rating 3 out of 5,"The short: If you've seen any of the television interviews or read any of the gossip magazine articles, you're already versed in the most interesting bits of Harry's memoir. If you enjoy psychological analysis and study, you'll find much to contemplate in this look at family and the connections and support we gain and lose. The long: It took me a very long time to make my way through Harry's story. Over a month of stopping and starting, putting off listening to another disc, enduring dull sections that didn't much interest me for their content. But as I started to think about what I might write in my review, I realized I was gaining many insights into Harry's character, the man he wishes to be, and the man he actually is, both figuratively and literally. The beginning was hard to get through with Harry's misplaced anger, whining, and lack of understanding of his role in situations. These very things are what makes his relationship with his family so precarious; he blames his family for things they can't control, whines when things don't go his way, and fails to see how he might have played his cards differently. He is very much a family man but with a very set definition of what composes a family in terms of behavioral and emotional fellowship. He has trouble accepting that his version of family can't and doesn't triumph each time. The role we imagine for ourselves and others will likely differ from the role those people imagine for themselves and us. We have to accept it and make the best of the relationships we do have in spite of them not living up to our dreams, which let's admit are always idealistic and perhaps even a touch fantastical.The second part covers his early adult years and military career. Much of this was rather boring to me but I see how these years gave him a modicum sense of control over his own life. His royal upbringing and loss of his mother at a young age left him struggling more than others to find his identity. The discipline and structure that the military both provides and builds gave Harry the means to come into this own in a more settled way.The third part offers Harry's perspective on all that has happened since meeting Meghan. You can tell he really wants to share his version of what happened (during the controversial gossip-worthy events), and he wants so much for everyone to like and accept him and Meghan. I listened to his version of events with a fair ear, but it's hard to know what to believe in the end as Harry clearly is rebelling against royal rules. He knows how the royal family works, but maybe doesn't understand why it works that way, and he wants it to be his way. He demonstrates an inability to see another perspective and to effectively work towards a viable compromise. He naively thinks he can change the narrative for himself and Meghan, but he can't as people have already chosen their position and/or are keenly aware that we are still only getting one side of the story. The Royal Family will never share their version in their own words and with their own voices. Also, we are not aware of all the ins and outs of royal policies and procedures, the spoken and unspoken rules that dictate behavior and appearance for those destined to live their lives on a pedestal. Upon reaching the end, I didn't find that Harry's story as told in his own words garnered any further sympathy from me. That's not to say I don't have any sympathy, I do feel for him in many ways, but no more than many of the people he attempted to shame. He is not the only one in a very difficult situation, and I believe all are doing their best in a monarchal system that at the same time is both highly private and highly public. This would make a great book club pick for royal watching psychology enthusiasts; one chapter could be discussed in depth each month for a true psychological study of all that has shaped Harry into the man he is today.

Rating 5 out of 5,"Before reading Spare, I watched the six episode Harry & Meghan on Netflix. I give both the book and the Netflix documentary five stars! I also read and highly recommend Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of a Modern Royal Family.Memoir is my favorite genre and I naturally gravitate to books where the obstacles seem unsurmountable, yet the author is able to create their own path forward despite fighting against real or perceived barriers, prison-like bars that trap them, familial expectations, cultural norms, or other challenges such as war, poverty, violence, disasters, disabilities, etc.I have no idea what living in a gilded cage would feel like with country, press, and family restraints. Add into that bubble-like existence not being or feeling valued or respected because the monarchy hierarchy doesn't view you as important. If I had to live that way, I would be one rebellious hell-raiser trying desperately to find my way out of that life and into the life I dreamed and imagined for myself. I also have no idea what life would be like if my mother, an incredible beacon of light, passed away early and I was left to fend for myself within a family that doesn't show emotion or compassion.From watching the Netflix documentary, I firmly believe that Harry and Meghan love each other very deeply. How the press and bloggers treat Meghan, particularly from a race perspective, is horrendous. If I was Harry, I would continually worry that relentless paparazzi could potentially cause harm or death to Meghan, which would be an unfortunate repeat of history.I admire Harry's authenticity, self-awareness (yes, he has made mistakes and he has learned from them---he has a terrific continual learner mindset), grit, determination, and fierce devotion to ensuring the health and safety of Meghan and their children. Against all odds, he is defining his identity and his future. He is the captain of his soul and his life. In his book, he states that freedom comes after struggle. He has struggled through many things and I am rooting for Harry and Meghan and their family to have many, many years of happiness and freedom.

Rating 2 out of 5,"2.25 stars I struggle so much with how to rate and review this book. I was excited to pick it up because I always liked Princess Diana and had a soft spot for her kids. Even though I’m not into the Royals, I was curious. This is probably one I should have skipped. I’m not going to criticize the writing or Harry’s story, but to be quite honest I was so bored through this book. I don’t know if it was too long or what, but I skipped over most of part 2 because I kept zoning out while listening and even though the first and third parts had some interesting things I still wasn’t into it. This could very much be a ‘me’ thing… I know a lot of people enjoyed this book, but it wasn’t for me.

Rating 5 out of 5," People did believe, and that was the whole problem. Britons, among the most literate people on the planet, were also the most credulous. Even if they didn't believe every word, there was always that residue of wonder. Hmm... where there's smoke there must be fire... Even if a falsehood was disproved, debunked beyond all doubt, that residue of initial belief remained.( eBook 362 of 522) I always ask my students after they finish a story to tell me what the main message is of the text. My main takeaway from ""Spare"" is that Prince Harry wishes for people to understand that the press has manipulated and twisted his story. So here he is setting the record straight and in this memoir, he discusses the loss of his mother, his schooling, his life in the army, his philanthropic endeavors, and his life with Meghan Markle. By doing so there is a general perception that this memoir and the many interviews in the last year or so have caused damage to not only Harry but all those he loves. Choosing to not be silent and speaking his truth has created a schism between him and his family. I used the annotation tools of my ebook and so I have included some of the excerpts that struck my Canadian heart.  To me, Prince Harry is a person who suffered the trauma of losing his mother when he was just a 12-year-old boy and did not receive the help he needed. This created a man who also needed help.  There seems to be a certain ideology that people won't read this book because "" they don't want to give money to make him rich.""Disclaimer right at the beginning of the book  Prince Harry wishes to support British charities with donations from proceeds from SPARE. The Duke of Sussex has donated 1, 500, 000 to Sentebale, an organization he founded with Prince Seeisio in their mother's legacies, which supports vulnerable children and young people in Lesotho and Botswana affected by HIV/AIDS. Prince Harry will also donate to the nonprofit organization WellChild in the amount of 300,000( pounds). WellChild, which he has been Royal patron of for fifteen years, makes it possible for children and young people with complex health needs to be cared for at home instead of hospital, wherever possible.( Page 2 of my ebook) I don't know about anyone else, but Prince Harry has always struck me as an adult who very much cares about others. Like his mother, Lady Diana, Harry has spent a lot of his adult life as a member of the British Royal Family supporting causes and working alongside organizations. Personally, I am satisfied that the money I paid for this ebook goes towards such causes.  On the subject of Charles's relationship with Camilla:... Willy and I promised Pa that we'd welcome Camilla into the family. The only thing we asked in return was that he not marry her... A wedding would cause controversy. It would incite the press. It would make the whole country, the whole world, talk about Mummy, compare Mummy and Camilla, and nobody wanted that. Least of all Camilla. ( eBook 109 0f 386- part 1 ""Out of the Night that Covers Me"") On the subject of Charles's marriage announcement:  Despite Willy and me urging him not to, Pa was going ahead. We pumped his hand, wished him well. No hard feelings. We recognized that he was finally going to be with the woman he loved, the woman he'd always loved, the woman Fate might've intended for him in the first place. Whatever bitterness or sorrow we felt over the closing of another loop in Mummy's story, we understood that it was beside the point. ( eBook 324 of 386 part 1 ""Out of the Night that Covers Me"")On meeting Meghan Markle: I'd traveled the world, from top to bottom, literally. I'd hopscotched the continents. I'd met hundreds of thousands of people, I'd crossed paths with a ludicrously large cross-section of the planet's seven billion residents. For thirty-two years I'd watched a conveyor -belt of faces pass by and only a handful ever made me look twice. This woman stopped the conveyor -belt. This woman smashed the conveyor-belt to bits. I'd never seen anyone so beautiful. ( Pg 2 of 481; "" Part 3 Captain of My Soul"")On the reaction to Harry's relationship with Meghan Markle: Everything I'd been taught, everything I'd grown up believing about the family, and about the monarchy, about its essential fairness, its job of uniting rather than dividing, was being undermined, called into question. Was it all fake? Was it all just a show? Because if we couldn't stand up for one another, rally around our newest member, our first biracial member, then what were we really? Was that a true constitutional monarchy? Was that a real family? Isn't ""defending each other"" the first rule of every family? ( eBook pg 337 of 481 Part 3 Captain of My Soul"" )On the monarchy:I'll forever support my Queen, my Commander in Chief, my granny. Even after she's gone. My problem has never been with the monarchy, nor the concept of monarchy. It's been with the press and the sick relationship between it and the Palace. I love my Mother Country, and I love my Family, and I always will. I just wish, at the second- darkest moment of my life, they'd both been there for me. And I believe they'll look back one day and wish they had one too. ( Ebook pg427 of 481 Part 3 Captain of My Soul"")  I am glad that I read the book on my own. I think most people have made up their minds about whether or not this memoir is worth their reading time. I feel bad for Prince Harry and I feel awful for Prince William. Both were born in my generation, I have followed their lives with curious interest. They've had the privilege and they've had trauma and I think that makes them all the more real and human to me because I am just one of those ""commoners."" One of them will be my King, one day. As for the ""Spare"", well, I think that he's going to change our world.

Rating 5 out of 5,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️💫 (4.5/5, Memoir)	As soon as I heard that Prince Harry was writing a memoir, I knew I had to read it. I have always had a vague interest in the royal family but never followed them closely. When Harry + Meghan got engaged, I was enamored by their love story. To be honest, it reminded me of a fabulous fictional book called The Royal We (honestly, after reading this book, I was shocked by how much that book got right about being a Prince).If you’re reading this review trying to work out if you should read this, let me help you! If you want to pull back the curtain on royal life and understand life from Harry’s POV, this is for you. If you hate Harry & Meghan, please skip this, and also, please skip sliding into my DMs with your passionate messages about those two.This story gets into the weeds of Harry’s life and focuses on his early years, his time in the military, and his relationship with M.  Much of this story, though, is focused on his all-consuming hatred of the press. Yet, even though I am far from royal (despite wearing a crown on my wedding day), I found many elements of his story... relatable?I found this story to alternate between being heartbreaking, heartwarming, delicious, cheeky, fascinating, funny, and frustrating.I thought the writing was well done and, at times, poetic.Maybe it’s the hopeless romantic in me, but Harry’s description of first seeing Meghan made me swoon. I thought that page was more romantic than most romance novels, probably because it’s a true story.Two things I think are important to know about this book: firstly, I made a critical mistake by reading it and instead should have listened to Harry himself narrate it. Secondly, the ghostwriter is the insanely talented J.R. Moehringer, who ghostwrote Phil Knight’s Shoe Dog, among many other books.I understand this book is not for everyone and is very polarizing. I personally enjoyed it immensely. If you’re on the fence, I might advise you to skip it, as I think you really have to be interested in the subject matter to make your way through this lengthy book.Best paired with a G + T.

Rating 2 out of 5,"In Spare, Harry tries to explains just how much the press have bullied him, from the time of his mother's demise to his marriage to Meghan. He says they were out to get him, they misunderstood him, hated him, dehumanised him. Tabloids didn't just stop at Harry, they viciously went after his wife, to the point he had to leave. He says he tried his best to stop the torments but he had to do it without his family's help because they didn't want to rile up the tabloids/press with a response. It's an impossible situation. The monarchy wouldn't want to do anything that'll anger the press because they have power over people's opinions(the press, that is) and the monarchy needs to remain in people's good graces to survive in this modern age.My thoughts: Sorry. Why was he so surprised by all this? This is the same country that colonized the world! Harry, be seriously pls. Of course they would hate Meghan! I feel bad for all the victims of british imperialism all around the world and all the ecosystems destroyed as a result of industrialization. Was really shocked to see just how much Harry and his family have access to Africa, they fight and argue over who gets to owns it!!? What Harry and his family want is a private life with all the benefits of royalty. Not possible son, let's be serious for once Harry.

Rating 2 out of 5,"Sorry, Prince Hal, but your book barely gets 2 stars.I wasn't expecting a masterpiece, but at the end of the day, ""Spare"" was a snore. It was more than a little difficult to get through, and yes, I had to skim various parts of it. And I know the ghostwriter is considered a good one, but the difference in voices was cringe-inducing, to say the least. In other words, I should be hearing Harry through the ghostwriter, but I didn't.One of the few worthwhile bits of the book was learning of the young prince's reaction to Diana's death, in the short-term, but especially in the longer term. And I did appreciate Prince Harry sharing his and Meghan's sides of various stories, so I suppose I'm still Team Harry and Meghan more than I ever was Team William and Kate. But the book is mostly, well, boring and not very well-written or presented. And I don't think he makes the best case for himself, and I often felt I was just hearing yet another over-privileged, and too often oblivious, rich white guy.Case in point: Harry shares that he was in the costume shop, trying to figure out which would be the most ridiculous getup he could find, so he called William and his then-girlfriend Kate to help him choose. He reveals that they egged him on to choose the infamous Nazi outfit. That's pretty shocking, if true, but... after I thought about it, THEY weren't the ones in the costume shop to begin with, THEY weren't the ones who narrowed down the choices to the two Harry called them about, and THEY weren't the ones who went with that outfit. So, yes, shame on William and Kate for laughing and thinking it would be a lark, but that doesn't take away from Harry's choices. Sorry, dude. (By the way, shame on the costume shop for having a Nazi outfit to begin with!)So, Harry, bro, still mostly like you, you've grown a lot over the years, you're out there advocating for mental health and resources, sharing your truth, and outing some hard and too-long hidden truths about your family, the press, endemic racism, so thank you, but...

My Blog | Twitter | Amazon | BRC Blog | StoryGraphI liked this book, a lot. Now I admit it will not win any literary prizes, well maybe it will based on its popularity, but it shouldn't. This isn't a bad book by any means, hence the four star rating. I just felt parts were a little boring and read more like a journal than a memoir. Harry starts his book with the death of his mother, Princess Diana. I was surprised by how emotional and intimate the book was. Her death clouds and eclipses every aspect of his life, good and bad. It broke my heart to read about it. Like his mother, he loves fiercely and believes family is first.I have got to give the man props for putting it all out there, warts and all. He knows his issues and is trying his best to deal with them. He takes responsibility for his actions for the most part, it is a shame his father and brother can't as it is apparent he loves them dearly. I was also surprised by how funny he was, I shouldn't have been as he was always fooling around as a child.The middle section of the book was uninteresting to me. It deals with Harry's life in the military. It describes his training and his deployment to Afghanistan. While I appreciate his service to his country and his Queen I was bored to tears. (Sorry!)I have usually sided with Meghan and Harry because of the simple fact he blames the press for the situation they found themselves in and he blames the family or the firm for not helping or supporting him and Meghan. Just look at the images below from British newspapers and tell me the press didn't have it out for Meghan. It can't be more evident than that. He gives clear and precise reasons why he chose to step down and I can't blame him one bit.It's okay for Kate to rub her bump but heaven forbid Meghan should do it.   And let's not forget when Kate eats avocados all is right in the world, when Meghan eats them she is contributing to human rights offences.     There isn't much new in the book but I loved that it was from Harry's mind, mouth and heart. If only we all had someone love us the way he loves Meghan.This title is currently available for purchase.

Rating 5 out of 5,"Spare is a candid and raw account of the life of a Prince. From a traumatized boy growing into a man, Harry has lived the majority of his life in a fishbowl... locked in a gilded cage? Either analogy fits.This eye-opening look inside his “very large, very ancient, very dysfunctional family” is equally refreshing and cringe worthy. It reads like a three-act Greek tragedy interspersed with some comedic interludes.Harry is open about his flaws and insecurities, alcohol and drug use, as well as his mental health journey. He apologizes for his poor choices and things he did wrong.This is also a rare look at the inner workings of the British Monarchy, the British press, and its insidious relationship with the Palace. Make no mistake, this is a very definitive break with protocol (and so like his mother, who also dared to challenge the status quo and upend the family dynamic).At the conclusion of this 400+ page memoir, I am left feeling a bit like I've accidentally walked in on someone in a state of undress — best avert my eyes and politely exit the room.Show more",5,Spare is a candid and raw account of the life of a Prince From a traumatized boy growing into a man Harry has lived the majority of his life in a fishbowl locked in a gilded cage Either analogy fitsThis eyeopening look inside his very large very ancient very dysfunctional family is equally refreshing and cringe worthy It reads like a threeact Greek tragedy interspersed with some comedic interludesHarry is open about his flaws and insecurities alcohol and drug use as well as his mental health journey He apologizes for his poor choices and things he did wrongThis is also a rare look at the inner workings of the British Monarchy the British press and its insidious relationship with the Palace Make no mistake this is a very definitive break with protocol and so like his mother who also dared to challenge the status quo and upend the family dynamicAt the conclusion of this 400 page memoir I am left feeling a bit like Ive accidentally walked in on someone in a state of undress  best avert my eyes and politely exit the roomShow more

Rating 1 out of 5,"I’d like to start off this review with a quote “My penis was oscillating between extremely sensitive and borderline traumatized”. That’s a sentence I never thought I’d hear a member of the royal family utter and that single quote should be enough for a low rating but oh boy is there more.The main concept of the book is that Harry is the overlooked “spare” of inheriting the throne. He complains about the fact that his brother and father’s lives were prioritized over his and sure that sucks but I’d like to look at a similar situation. Princess Margaret was the “spare” to Elizabeth and she lived a very (from what we’ve seen) sad life. She was denied marriage to her first love and constantly overlooked and placed to the side. Now roll back to Harry, while he’s not the heir, the amount of attention and influence he has far outweighed Margaret and hey, he got to marry Meghan and live out his life while damaging his family. I understand he wants to rant about his feelings but a memoir isn’t the place, at least in my opinion. I would like to point out the this book wasn’t released until after the passing of Elizabeth, giving him the green light to go ahead for whatever he wanted to write about. I know that he feels mistreated by his family and all but to actually write a very public exposé detailing every small complaint of grievance you have just seems like a petty way to get revenge. Diana did an interview with a similar concept but that was an interview, and Diana’s situation was much more dire than Harry’s. Regardless if you’re royal or not, publicly shaming your family seems a little immature for an almost 40 year old.Harry says that the press and paparazzi was too much and felt as though he had no privacy, yet he decided to write a whole book detailing the most TMI shit I’ve ever read, going from his frostbitten dick to losing his virginity to an “older woman”. So if you’re concerned about your privacy, why are you writing a book about the most intimate and uncomfortable moments of your life. This makes me think this was all an elaborate money and clout grab, Harry gets back to being talked about (see even I’m talking about him) and gets a fat paycheck on the side.Overall I feel like I wasted hours of my life reading this, and if you’re really interested I’m not gonna stop you but, just be ready for whatever the hell this was. Prince Harry was better as a child on the crown than he is in real life.

Rating 3 out of 5,"It’s a fine celeb memoir. Parts 1 & 3 were the best by far. Part 2 was sooooo boring. Harry’s idea of “truth” basically excludes all the bad parts of him, which is fine, but doesn’t make for a great book. I liked the stuff about his mother, father, brother, and Meghan. Needed a better editor. Strong writing on a sentence level but overall storytelling, not good. Too long.

Rating 1 out of 5,"Before I get into my comments on this book. I thought I would share some of the words taken from my 10 year old sisters story about Prince Harry, called 'The Spoiled Little Prince"", that surprised our family and friends and she wants you to hear them.....He learned to complain, he accused everybody except himself, he told lies, he did many bad things to his family and he was angry all the time. He hurt and betrayed everyone that made everyone angry too. His heart was poison so ........... he did not live happily ever after.If only this story of the Spoiled little prince was only a fairy tale….. but it isn’t. The spoiled little prince is Prince Harry. We want someone in America to adopt our spoiled little prince - pleaseSays it all doesn't it. My little sister asked my Mum about why the book was called 'Spare' to which my Mum relayed some reasons. Tania wanted my Mum to show her the house Harry lived in that had the small bedroom he refers to in his book. You can imagine the response, but trying to make a 10 year girl understand is hard, she just said maybe I should have called my story 'The Greedy little Prince'__________________________________I will keep my review short because I don't want to waste any more of my time on this garbage than I have to. Here are a few reasons why I hate this book1) This book reads like one very long drunken email to anyone who would listen, about how evil and bad everyone was to this petulant ungrateful prince2) It is the most hypocritical and contradictory book or article that I have ever read. 3) He complains about the media and look at the media attention he has created to help sell his book4) He complains about privacy and he 'tells all' about a family who do everything to stay private 5) He blames the royal family for not looking after Meghan but why didn't he get her a shrink. He had many of them and even talks about ringing one straight away. I think he is deflecting his own failure onto others. He was her husband and had connections, why didn't he look after her when she was suicidal instead of dragging her out to a celebration. Harry should take responsibility for this too - but of course he doesn't. It's always somebody else's fault. 6) His comments and insults were so petty he lost any moral high ground. My friends don't use his name any more he is just referred to as the 'ginger whinger'I was the second child of two until 10 years ago when Tania was born. I had the smaller bedroom. I did't feel hard done by. Yet this self pitying tw.. has vastly more wealth, a gazillion houses, endless holidays, the best education - all of this my parents helped pay for and he wants pity. He didn't know he was living - that's his problem now he has to make money somewhere. Harry has to take responsibility for how badly he came across in this book.Few people in the UK are buying into this rubbish. Do not come back for the Coronation. You are not welcome.Please read 'Margaret M's' review - she provides a fantastic analysis of this book, without having to lower herself to the vicious vitriol that Harry has provided in his story.

Rating 4 out of 5,"3.5 ☆ rounded up  ""Never complain, never explain."" ~~ the Windsor family mottoThe monarchy, always, at all costs, had to be protected. Henry Charles Albert David of Wales, better known as Prince Harry, blew the family motto out of the water in Spare. His memoir began the day before his mother, Princess Diana, died unexpectedly in a car accident in 1997. This loss has been a life-defining event shaping both his behavior during his adolescence and his major life goals as an adult. 

 [People] heard the word ""royal,"" or ""prince,"" and lost all rationality. ""Ah, a prince-- you have no problem.""They assume ... no, they'd been taught ... it was all a fairytale. We weren't human. 

Prince Harry clearly had several objectives for his memoir. In addition to presenting his version of life events, he wanted to remind readers that he is a person. He is human, subject to all the foibles and faults that accompany being human. Indeed, he struck me as an unexceptional bloke who had been born into extraordinary circumstances. The early sections of his book comprised a lean chronological narrative; it read like a loose chain of calendar entries. Introspection was something Prince Harry adroitly avoided until his twenties. In particular, the furor from his wearing of a Nazi uniform for a costume party led to this epiphany -- 

 ... the result of various failures--failure of thinking, failure of character. But it had also been a failure of education. Not just school education, but self-education. I'd resolved to change that. I couldn't become the person I hoped to be until I changed that. 

The middle section of Spare dwelled primarily upon his military training and service years. And the final third was about his relationship with his wife Meghan Markle. One consistent theme throughout the entire memoir was how vile and dangerous the combination of celebrity culture and the media, especially the staff from Murdoch's media empire, were and are.Memoirs and autobiographies are not my favorite genres within nonfiction. Furthermore, I'm not one to follow celebrity gossip. But the past few decades' worth of news coverage centered around the late Princess Diana and her two sons have been unavoidable. Prince Harry's life was foreign to me, not only because we're of different genders and nationalities but because of his privileged status (wealth, boarding school, and extensive travel). His privilege though was one that came in a gilded cage with thick bars and a heavy-duty lock (bodyguards and paparazzi). I could empathize with his desire for common human decency for he is somebody who has been unrelentingly stalked by the media for the entirety of his life. And the media's behavior has exacted severe consequences from him in both his career and his relationships. My main motivation to read Spare was because of a major event in my own family -- the death of my mother in January. There's nothing like a funeral to expose any dysfunction within a family and I was not exempt. I wanted a distraction from my family's dysfunction by reading about someone else's familial imperfections. This memoir (sad to say) successfully accomplished this goal.As memoirs / autobiographies are not my favorite nonfiction, it takes a lot to get 5 stars from me -- I must be inspired, emotionally moved, and / or derived a new understanding of some topic. This memoir didn't attain that standard for despite its sincerity, it lacked eloquence and sometimes discretion. Nonetheless, I commend Prince Harry for his bravery and honesty in the revelations of his mental health challenges. I wish him and his family the best as they forge their own paths.I leave the bigger issues of the institution of the monarchy, its historic / questionable role in amassing tremendous wealth, and its future in a democracy up to those who have to live with it.Show more",4,"35  rounded up  Never complain never explain  the Windsor family mottoThe monarchy always at all costs had to be protected Henry Charles Albert David of Wales better known as Prince Harry blew the family motto out of the water in Spare His memoir began the day before his mother Princess Diana died unexpectedly in a car accident in 1997 This loss has been a lifedefining event shaping both his behavior during his adolescence and his major life goals as an adult

Rating 1 out of 5,"1.6 stars I regret the time I wasted reading this. Luckily I didn't pay for the book as my mum bought it and let me borrow it after her (she only made it to page 150). Spare is a tedious, confused and overwritten read about the musings of a petulant and petty prince who is constantly making himself out to be a victim. He certainly doesn't garner much sympathy from me. 👑 What the memoir is about 👑Prince Harry begins the memoir reflecting back to his 12-year-old self when he received the devastating news that his mother, the much loved Princess Diana had died. The memoir then looks back on Harry's adolescent years followed by his army service and relationship with Meghan Markle. Interwoven into the narrative is Harry's hatred of the media and their invasion into his private life, and the ubiquitous trauma that his mother's death has left behind. 👑 The good 👑- The trauma of Diana's death is extremely relatable especially to those who have lost a parent. Having lost my father at a similar age to Harry, I experienced much of the same trauma which has to this day never left me. - Parts of Harry's time serving in the army were very poignant to read about especially his courage to fight for his country, loyalty towards his fellow soldiers and the trauma of his experiences. I felt a lot of respect towards Harry for that especially as he also did a lot of charity work to help soldiers and their families after leaving the army. Harry was genuinely devastated that he couldn't continue serving his country due to security reasons putting him and the other soldiers at risk. Even after leaving the army he still wanted to support his fellow soldiers which was touching. - It was moving to read about Harry's fondness of Africa and the special place Botswana has for him in his heart.👑 The bad (this is going to be long) 👑- Despite the poignant parts about his struggle after his mother's death and his army service, my opinion of Harry is still very much unchanged. Whilst I do feel for him having had lost his mother at a young age and the lack of privacy because of his birthright, Harry comes across as an immature and entitled brat for whom nothing is ever right. I don't think that Harry is a bad person, but I think that he's very lost and has been manipulated by Meghan.Harry constantly throws his family under the bus, revealing his petty squabbles and undercurrents of sibling rivalry with William, and King Charles never doing enough in Harry's eyes despite Charles trying his best. Actually contrary to portraying Charles in a bad light, my opinion of Charles has really gone up hugely. He seemed to be far from the cold and stiff upper lip father I imagined him to be. He always called Harry ""my darling boy"" and always let Harry know how proud he was of him. He'd leave Harry notes telling him how proud he was of him and when he was younger would stay with Harry until he fell asleep as he was afraid of the dark. But no, Harry always finds something to grumble about. ""Why couldn't he tell me he's proud instead of leave me notes? Why couldn't he hug me? Why did he have to laugh in my school play when no one else was laughing? My father wasn't cut out to be a single parent. We begged our father not to marry Camilla but he did anyway."" If anything, it reflects badly on Harry. No parent is perfect, but it seems like Charles really did have his heart in the right place and showed his sons warmth and love despite being raised in a family that doesn't show emotion or physical affection. How can he expect Charles to hug him when he wasn't raised to show any physical affection?? Also Charles respected his son's wishes not to marry Camilla (the boys were young when they asked him not to marry her) and waited many years until the boys were in their 20's.Harry so paints himself to be a perpetual victim. Yes I can understand how vile the media can be and how they can make people's lives hell, but Harry acts as if he's the only one. Nobody has suffered in the hands of the media as much as him and Meghan. Camilla tries to advise and support Meghan after her own experience of being hounded by the press and being a hated figure for years for her affair with Charles during his marriage to Diana. But no, according to Harry, it was different for Camilla and she didn't get as much hate (I beg to differ). He only thinks about himself and not how his family deal with the press. He makes it seem like his family welcome the media and are happy with the intrusion which I'm sure they're not. I'm sure the other members of the Royal Family have their own frustrations with the media but knowing they can't do much, it's better to forge a relationship with them in which they grant some privacy than fight against them and only give them more power. I understand how difficult it must be not to be able to walk down the street or go to the shops without being papped, but Harry also says there are times when he has privacy and isn't hounded by the media especially in other countries. Harry claims that he escaped the UK to get away from the media, but what he's doing now is selling his soul to the media, inviting the media to his home and doing constant interviews. This is very contradictory and not behavior of someone who wants a private life. If he wanted a private life so badly, why not go to a remote place where it's hard for people to find you or live in a gated community or home with strict security? It seems like in his dwellings in the UK he was protected from the media and paps. Instead of following Charles' advice, ""just don't read the papers darling boy"", Harry himself seems obsessed with the media. You'd think from his experience he'd have learnt to ignore it and the ridiculous stories and develop a more objective view. He claims that Meghan was so hated by the media but there was also a lot of positive stuff about Meghan. There were people who liked her and who didn't like her, but that's the same with anybody else in the public eye.I initially liked Meghan and was glad that she was marrying into the Royal Family- I felt that it was time for the Royal Family to be more diverse towards people from different backgrounds and races marrying in in which they proved that they are flexible and diverse. I know a lot of people who had positive views about Meghan initially. The racism in the media was completely unacceptable and should never be allowed. Unfortunately there is racism, sexism, anti-Semitism and other forms of discrimination but Harry and Meghan act like the only ones to experience any type of prejudice and discrimination. Instead of actively trying to tackle racism and discrimination, Harry doesn't do any action. He claims that he wasn't allowed to do anything but that's b*ll. It didn't have to include suing the media, but openly discussing racism and discrimination and trying to fight it by working with organisations and using his position to spread the word. Harry is so ridiculously petty especially when he writes about Kate and Meghan's little dramas and his rivalry and drama with William (despite the rivalry there seems to be a lot of love between the brothers) which isn't fair on William. What siblings don't argue? - I doubt the accuracy and credibility of Harry's book. There were numerous factual errors which have been backed up. Also it's hard to trust what Harry says in his hate-fuelled vitriol. There's two sides to every story and the Royal Family haven't commented on Harry's claims. Harry just comes across as angry and out there to get anyone who doesn't think that Meghan is the best thing since sliced bread. He won't allow anyone to say the slightest criticism of Meghan. He claims that William's views of Meghan are influenced by the media, but William obviously had his own reasons for not being keen on Meghan. After all, he's not the first person to not get along with or have doubts about an in-law. Harry never states the actual reason why William doesn't like Meghan. Um maybe because she's manipulative, rude and a drama queen? His whole spiel about the process to leave the Royal Family isn't clear- he claims he didn't want to leave fully but they gave him no choice; it was either stay or leave completely. Harry claims that Charles was his boss and in charge of money and payment, but wouldn't the Queen have been in charge of that when she was alive? Harry claims that Charles was hesitant about Meghan becoming a working royal as it would cost him more money. That really didn't make sense especially as she quit acting in order to carry out royal duties. So yeah, I don't really trust everything that Harry says especially as Harry's account is an incoherent, poorly structured and messy diatribe that is all over the place. Most of it makes little sense and sounds like it's coming from an angry, emotional and illogical place. - Many say that the book was well written but I think that it was very poorly written. It was a struggle to actually finish this book because it was so overwritten, scatterbrained and overly detailed. I ended up skipping parts because I was just so bored. The book is far too long as there's far too many irrelevant events and people. I ended up getting confused with the sheer amount of people that Harry mentions. Too much detail is given to insignificant things like Harry's pilot training and planes- very boring and pretty much Greek to those who don't know much about planes, weapon and combat. There were parts that were really unnecessary and pointless to mention such as Henry's frostbitten ""todger"", losing his virginity and fling with the late Caroline Flack. Honestly the guy is obsessed with talking about his manhood. TMI (too much information)- no one wants to read about somebody's private parts. For a prince, Harry's life is relatively uninteresting. Apart from being in the army, Harry hasn't really achieved anything in his life. There's nothing really fascinating about the life of an entitled boy who hasn't really grown up and spends his time moaning and blaming others instead of doing anything positive and useful with his life. 👑 Conclusion 👑Spare is a poorly written memoir, well diatribe to be precise about a poor little rich boy who is constantly whining and whinging about how him and his wife suffer more than anybody else and how everyone is out to get them. I really struggle to understand how this book has an average of 4.1 on Goodreads. People are obviously allowing themselves to be manipulated by Harry's sob story- ""I lost my mum, the world is so unfair and everyone is out there to get me and my wife and because I lost my mum it's an excuse for me to act like a brat and take no responsibility for my actions wah wah wah."" Seriously don't bother with this book.Grade: D-/ E+Show more",1,16 stars I regret the time I wasted reading this Luckily I didnt pay for the book as my mum bought it and let me borrow it after her she only made it to page 150 Spare is a tedious confused and overwritten read about the musings of a petulant and petty prince who is constantly making himself out to be a victim He certainly doesnt garner much sympathy from me  What the memoir is about Prince Harry begins the memoir reflecting back to his 12yearold self when he received the devastating news that his mother the much loved Princess Diana had died The memoir then looks back on Harrys adolescent years followed by his army service and relationship with Meghan Markle Interwoven into the narrative is Harrys hatred of the media and their invasion into his private life and the ubiquitous trauma that his mothers death has left behind  The good  The trauma of Dianas death is extremely relatable especially to those who have lost a parent Having lost my father at a similar age to Harry I experienced much of the same trauma which has to this day never left me  Parts of Harrys time serving in the army were very poignant to read about especially his courage to fight for his country loyalty towards his fellow soldiers and the trauma of his experiences I felt a lot of respect towards Harry for that especially as he also did a lot of charity work to help soldiers and their families after leaving the army Harry was genuinely devastated that he couldnt continue serving his country due to security reasons putting him and the other soldiers at risk Even after leaving the army he still wanted to support his fellow soldiers which was touching  It was moving to read about Harrys fondness of Africa and the special place Botswana has for him in his heart The bad this is going to be long  Despite the poignant parts about his struggle after his mothers death and his army service my opinion of Harry is still very much unchanged Whilst I do feel for him having had lost his mother at a young age and the lack of privacy because of his birthright Harry comes across as an immature and entitled brat for whom nothing is ever right I dont think that Harry is a bad person but I think that hes very lost and has been manipulated by MeghanHarry constantly throws his family under the bus revealing his petty squabbles and undercurrents of sibling rivalry with William and King Charles never doing enough in Harrys eyes despite Charles trying his best Actually contrary to portraying Charles in a bad light my opinion of Charles has really gone up hugely He seemed to be far from the cold and stiff upper lip father I imagined him to be He always called Harry my darling boy and always let Harry know how proud he was of him Hed leave Harry notes telling him how proud he was of him and when he was younger would stay with Harry until he fell asleep as he was afraid of the dark But no Harry always finds something to grumble about Why couldnt he tell me hes proud instead of leave me notes Why couldnt he hug me Why did he have to laugh in my school play when no one else was laughing My father wasnt cut out to be a single parent We begged our father not to marry Camilla but he did anyway If anything it reflects badly on Harry No parent is perfect but it seems like Charles really did have his heart in the right place and showed his sons warmth and love despite being raised in a family that doesnt show emotion or physical affection How can he expect Charles to hug him when he wasnt raised to show any physical affection Also Charles respected his sons wishes not to marry Camilla the boys were young when they asked him not to marry her and waited many years until the boys were in their 20sHarry so paints himself to be a perpetual victim Yes I can understand how vile the media can be and how they can make peoples lives hell but Harry acts as if hes the only one Nobody has suffered in the hands of the media as much as him and Meghan Camilla tries to advise and support Meghan after her own experience of being hounded by the press and being a hated figure for years for her affair with Charles during his marriage to Diana But no according to Harry it was different for Camilla and she didnt get as much hate I beg to differ He only thinks about himself and not how his family deal with the press He makes it seem like his family welcome the media and are happy with the intrusion which Im sure theyre not Im sure the other members of the Royal Family have their own frustrations with the media but knowing they cant do much its better to forge a relationship with them in which they grant some privacy than fight against them and only give them more power I understand how difficult it must be not to be able to walk down the street or go to the shops without being papped but Harry also says there are times when he has privacy and isnt hounded by the media especially in other countries Harry claims that he escaped the UK to get away from the media but what hes doing now is selling his soul to the media inviting the media to his home and doing constant interviews This is very contradictory and not behavior of someone who wants a private life If he wanted a private life so badly why not go to a remote place where its hard for people to find you or live in a gated community or home with strict security It seems like in his dwellings in the UK he was protected from the media and paps Instead of following Charles advice just dont read the papers darling boy Harry himself seems obsessed with the media Youd think from his experience hed have learnt to ignore it and the ridiculous stories and develop a more objective view He claims that Meghan was so hated by the

Rating 2 out of 5,"I was NOT in fact ever planning on reading Spare, as I have slowly but surely come to be finding Prince Harry hugely annoying and almost as much as I massively do loathe and despise trophy wife and constant ""I am just a poor victim of circumstances"" prima donna Meghan Markle. And therefore I (naturally) did not want to be bombarded in Spare with the constant whining and complaining that have turned me so absolutely away from ANY interviews given by Harry and Meghan or from one-sided (often American) media stories about them and their takes on things. But when I received a copy of Spare as a belated Christmas present, I (but admittedly more than a bit grudgingly) decided to at least try the book and to see what Prince Harry and his ghost writer J.R. Moehringer have penned (and I was also at least partially willing enough to approach Spare with a relatively open mind and to consider Prince Harry's remembrances and feelings seriously or at least as seriously as I could manage). However, my willingness to cut Prince Harry some slack, it really only lasted for a very short while and basically disappeared and disintegrated pretty quickly after part one of Spare. For yes, while the chapters of Spare about Princess Diana's death are both relatable, totally heartbreaking and that I certainly do feel major empathy and sympathy for Prince Harry's loss and also majorly annoyed and even rather furious that neither his father (Prince Charles) nor his grandparents (Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Phillip) seemed to have noticed and taken seriously Harry's emotional trauma and that he was not dealing with his grief in a healthy and productive manner (for honestly, it should have been realised that Harry was in total denial regarding his mother's death and was actually thinking that Princess Diana was in hiding), but well, everything in Spare that follows this pretty good and pretty decent first part, I indeed have textually found at best textually aggravating and at worst the horrible and entitled complaining rant of a spoiled rotten and rather massively ridiculous and cringe-worthy childish brat. Because truly and in my opinion, with Prince Harry and J.R. Moehringer's text for Spare, after the above mentioned and engagingly sympathetic and personable beginning section, it becomes ever increasingly difficult for me to feel even remotely sorry for Harry as a person (and also as a royal), as there is just too much dirty laundry, too much of a woe is me attitude and casting himself as only ever being a victim, and with Harry also very gladly and even almost gleefully throwing every member of his family under the proverbial bus so to speak (and also kind of seemingly expecting this all to be accepted and tolerated with good grace, total understanding and no negativity and criticism). But sorry, Prince Harry, in my opinion, a very sizeable majority of your memoirs, of what you and your ghost writer are textually presenting in Spare is rude, nasty and totally, horribly undignified. And yes, Prince Harry should also own up to the many instances of bad behaviour and poor judgement he has exhibited over the years, as while Harry dressing up as a Nazi and his years of substance abuse are candidly enough depicted in Spare, there is also a major lack of taking personal responsibility for his behaviour to be found and with Harry generally blaming others and his mental health issues for his misdeeds but not being all that willing to blame himself as well (which I do find quite horrible and pretty annoyingly unacceptable). And finally, while Harry throughout Spare being angry and furious at the British and the European tabloid press regarding not only himself but also concerning both his late mother and his current wife is certainly massively justified, I also tend to think that both Harry and Meghan have often been the instigators of their own misfortunes with regard to excessive ands problematic media coverage (and that sadly, this is never even once considered in Spare, with Harry and Meghan being continuously cast and shown only as victims and the media only as perpetrators). Because let's face it, Prince Harry's numerous shenanigans over the years, they certainly have made him a rather legitimate negative media target (and yes, this in my opinion is Harry's own doing and his own fault), and that indeed, considering what happened with the late Princess Diana, Meghan Markle also should have totally and one hundred percent expected the kind of public and press scrutiny she would be receiving by marrying into the British Royal Family and that Harry should definitely have sufficiently prepared his bride to be for this. So yes, while one part of Spare I have certainly and for the most part enjoyed reading (and that I definitely do appreciate how painful Princess Diana's death was for her sons, and seemingly in particular so for Prince Harry), there is just way way too much whining, too much self centred pathological narcissism, too much of a victim mentality and definitely too much of an entitled rant textually present in Spare that I really cannot and will not consider more than a two star rating for Prince Harry's memoirs (and to also say that having a ghost writer is kind of ridiculous, and that I might well be considering the text for Spare a bit more favourably and positively had Prince Harry written this by himself and not with J.R. Moehringer, because yes, if you want to pen your memoirs or your autobiography, in my opinion and from my point of view, you should be writing this by yourself and not with a ghost writer).And I really do not know if I want to even keep my gifted copy around, as I rather do NOT want Spare taking up precious space on my shelves, as the book, as Spare really does make me majorly and super livid, and in particular so, when I consider that Charles, Camilla, William, Kate (and the rest of the family) are supposedly not even really permitted to publicly call Prince Harry and Meghan out and offer any type of official rebuttals.Show more",2,I was NOT in fact ever planning on reading Spare as I have slowly but surely come to be finding Prince Harry hugely annoying and almost as much as I

Rating 5 out of 5,"While the British Royal Family have always been a topic of great interest to many, the recent release of a tell-all memoir by HRH Prince Harry added some refreshing honesty and bluntness to the scandalous pieces that have littered bookstores or tabloid pages. Told from the heart and through his own eyes, Prince Harry provides the reader with his perspective, as the ‘Royal spare’, in contrast with his brother’s the heir to the throne. It’s poignant release months after the death of Queen Elizabeth II makes the honest commentary all the more sobering as the monarchy is again being put under the spotlight. Nothing short of eye opening for those who have the regime to read it!HRH Prince Harry Wales had a purpose from the moment he was born; to be the Royal spare, should older brother, William, not live to ascend to the throne. Harry has lived with this moniker ever since and while it was not bluntly presented in every discussion of his early life, it was there. The world knew of Harry from a young age, but it was only after the death of his mother, Princess Diana, that people started to take notice. This memoir picks up there, just before the fatal car accident in 1997. Harry spends the first portion of the book discussing his ‘spare’ title and how he made his way through school and life in a post-Diana world. He drank, he took drugs, but he was not entirely a reprobate. While he was forced to live in his brother’s shadow at Eton, he made a namer for himself and strove to earn his keep, albeit on his own terns.Harry turned to a life of charity after school, wanting to visit places in Africa and other parts of the world, as well as a stint in Australia. He sought to get dirt under his nails and make a difference. He found himself wanting to do more than sit at a desk, which is what drew him to military service. While there were many controversies about it, Harry pushed through and found himself ready for combat, with a number of arenas in which he could serve. He challenged the ‘protect all royals’ sentiment and advocated to be sent to Iraq or Afghanistan, even if he would have to arrive there converted, so as not to paint a target on his back. Harry recounts of his many adventures in training as well as in Afghanistan, putting his passion to use and making a difference, all before his identity was discovered and he was forced to return to the United Kingdom. Again, he could not shake the ‘royal’ label, wishing to serve as anyone else beside him, but this was not to be.By the book’s third section, Harry delves into tryin to put his personal life in order, being a hot-blooded man and having seen William wed Kate Middleton. This section focuses on the way in which Harry and Meghan Markle met, dated, courted, and eventually decided to marry. Harry is blunt and completely honest about his feelings and the giddiness he felt with anything Meghan. The couple slowly and determinedly kept seeing one another, as best they could under the radar of the press, connecting on many levels, even when many within Harry’s family thought it a bad idea to date. There were early attacks towards Meghan about her past, her race, and even her life choices, all of which Harry raged that nothing was done to defend her. Still, he would not be dissuaded from marrying the woman he loved, even as the likes of Prince (now King) Charles tried to downplay her for fear that it would shine the limelight on someone other than him. The couple’s nuptials are described in detail here and show a truly fairytale nature to them, forced into pomp and circumstance when they wanted something simple in Africa.The rest of the third part of the book explores the ongoing struggles that Harry and Meghan had with the British media, public, and the royals themselves. Meghan tried to live her life as best she knew it, but was not ‘Princess Perfection’ as Harry explains. While many within the Royal family usually circle to protect their own, Harry recounts how many left Meghan to be feasted upon, to the point that she contemplated suicide. While some may say that this was melodramatic, the way Harry presents it and from the recollections I have from media accounts, the pain was real and pushed a wedge between Harry and the rest of his family, as well as his country.The thing about tell-all pieces is that they reveal the warts as well as the great things that happen. This can sour many people who read the book, making them feel this is just about whining or causing a scene. However, one must step back and wonder if this is the author’s way of getting things off their chest, unpinning the media portrayal and offering their heartfelt perspective. While I cannot know how much of the book was complete fact, I must say that Prince Harry offered up powerful and personal opinions, sacrificing himself to try to right the record for all. His flowing narrative was in line with what I would like, rather than a stuffed shirt approach to storytelling. His short chapters, while confounding me in the early stages, began working well for me and left an indelible mark. They pushed me to read on, as there was so much told and great deal more teased with each chapter’s progression. This is the perfect way to lure the reader in. Lots to tell and Harry did that, offering up blunt and honest perspectives, as well as opinions about those around him. While some might pan it as being too full of complaint, I applaud the honesty that Prince Harry offered and the actions he took to protect his immediate family from the harshness that was and is British society.Kudos, Prince Harry, for setting the record straight, even as you were left out in the cold by your family at the time you needed them most.Love/hate the review?

Rating 4 out of 5,"I feel completely neutral about the royal family and the monarchy in general, but I tend to like redheads, so I've always liked Prince Harry. Plus, I adore historical romances, and I've swooned over hundreds of smitten duke/earl/viscounts... fictional ones, that is. It was interesting how this audiobook really changed my view of real-life royals. Spare was clearly ghostwritten, not only because some of the prose felt very flowery, but I feel like the real Prince Harry was more evident in little sections off-color humor or crasser segments that made its way into the book. Prince Harry doesn't seem like the most... bookish sort. He seems much more at home in the military and with his friends, and feels like a person who wasn't made to be fancy, if that makes sense. I'm not sure how much of this book is embellished (I can't picture either of them with Ikea furniture... Meghan buying stuff from Ikea??), but I'm not going to be one of the psycho royal sycophants who tries to play ""gotcha"" games with minor details that Harry recalls in the story. So what if he remembers some stuff a little differently than it actually was... hell, I can't keep my own history straight either half the time. What this story really comes down to is a man who felt like a puppet all of his life. He felt out of control and hounded by the press, surrounded by people who didn't really see him as a person. I'm happy he found happiness with Meghan, and I don't think any sane person could fault him for wanted to protect his wife. Meghan was treated terribly by the press, and she really didn't deserve a bit of it. I think Harry did a decent job narrating his own story. He was nice to listen to, and I enjoyed the whole experience and getting to know Harry a bit better. Sure, he overshared a number of times (peeing his pants?? TMI...), and he revealed a surprising amount about his father and brother, but I guess he just wanted to get his whole story out there. I hope the British population really gives this story some consideration and they stop holding Harry to a standard that he never asked for or wanted.

Rating 1 out of 5,"I have been a long-standing fan of Harry, the young boy who walked behind his mother’s hearse. The rascal in his teens through to his late 20’s who refused to be moulded. The boy who seemed to delight in breaking the rules and with incidents like his naked pool parties many of us secretly laughed and delighted in such antics. Some were tasteless too though!!! However, the point is this ‘spare’ had less demands put on him, and we were all ok with that because he was the lovable rascal.Then everything went wrong and perhaps it is entirely coincidental, but the turning point seems to be Megan, the one that William appears to have disapproved off, if Harry is to be believed. Time will prove if we were also right to be concerned, but now I don’t care, because Harry has lost me as a fan. I have no respect for him, and to make such a statement I should explain why? My issues are as follows:Providing a body count of kills in Afghanistan is wrong and irresponsible and goes against my belief that all life is precious. To refer to people as chess pieces is thoughtless and immoral and has put the lives of others at risk if the threats of the Taliban are to be believed. But of course once again he is taking NO responsibility instead accusing the press of manipulating his words. NO they are in the book that you wrote Harry. This is your doing.Secondly, it is the sheer hypocrisy in so much of what Harry writes, I just don’t get it. How can you complain about press invasion and harassment and then do the very same thing to your family, but worse. Then use the press to promote your inexcusable rhetoric. A family he knows will not respond or counter these claims because they “..never complain never explain”. From my perspective this was cowardly. I might have more respect had Harry allowed himself to be interviewed properly instead of the series of soft interviews he had, which I found insulting.Had more damming revelations been disclosed, in this much hyped book, I could have gone the other way, not that I wish badness on anyone, but I could justify why Harry has embarked on such a venomous mission, towards his family and particularly his brother.It is the attack on William that I find one of the most distasteful. There were lots of petty details and personal insults like William’s baldness, that I thought were unwarranted and hurtful. I never expected Harry to feel jealousy towards his better-looking brother, but then we didn’t see everything. It seems to have exposed the real motive here and it feels like jealously for his elder brother.The Royal Family have taken a different approach to Harry in that they have decided to avoid battles with the press and rise above the insults and accusations that are frequently made. Yet this man, who is not known for being intelligent believes this means they are working against him and planting stories. NO HARRY THE PRESS NO LONGER LIKE YOU. Dear people, let me tell you something about William. He lost his mother too, he too walked behind her coffin. He shared his struggle with mental health after her death and over the years, and yet Harry does this to him. Unforgiveable. William may have reacted physically (which was wrong) driven by the deep concerns he and many of us had about Megan being the right person for our darling Harry. This comes through in the book.My last issue is the book title. We are meant to feel sorry for this privileged and self indulgent ‘spare’ who for many years was third in line after Charles and William, with the lifestyle and education to match. Spare you ungrateful whinger.My message to Harry about him and his book is this:I no longer recognise this self-pitying, self-absorbed hypocrite. This person who complains after such a privileged life – how dare you. How dare you complain about the press when you do this.Spare us any more of this hypocrisy;Spare us any more of this poison;Spare us the ‘managed soft interviews’. Talk to people who are prepared to challenge you because you know the royal family will not do that publicly; Spare us the organised pap photos, that photographers claim you set up then complained about;Spare us the attacks on the decent people in the Royal Family like William. Just so you know I am not singling you out, I have no time for Camilla either and some others. I am team William after this.I really wanted you to reveal something worthwhile, something that people could understand – but you did none of that. You appear to have sold your family, your integrity, and your honesty for thirty pieces of silver. I am no longer a fan. I am disgusted by this book. You have had your say, much of which is uninteresting, some of it contradictory and most of it hurtful, but anyway I hope it was worth it.

Rating 4 out of 5,"I have never believed in the validity of hierarchies of importance and entitlement. I could not have explained this to you as a very young child, but that is when I clearly saw the fallacy—in my young mind, “craziness”—of the whole notion that grownups were superior because their greater size and strength enabled them to brutalize me, or that boys were more important than girls, as my mother tried to tell me in the 1950s. As far back as I can remember I knew that people were no more important than each other or animals or plants. We all “were” and therefore we deserved to be. And later when I learned about religions, that too made no sense. Deities? Beings or powers so great that they deserved worship? If something is truly great, worship by others is irrelevant, as is fearing or fawning. Great beings see with equal eyes and want everybody to know their own greatness. Perhaps they are lonely and want eye-to-eye company.When I grew up and made my living in offices, my habit of addressing male bosses as equals drove several of them crazy. I believe hierarchies are a good method for achieving certain goals in an orderly way, but that has nothing to do with superior worth or entitlement of individuals, and respect has nothing to do with servile subordination.When I got my first dog, I was curious about who she was, what she liked and wanted. I went to a training school called “People Training for Dogs” which appealed to me; it helped us learn one another’s language and therefore become a better team. None of my subsequent dogs were “pets.” They were my family, my partners, and we merely had different responsibilities: mine were to take care of them, protect them, love them; theirs were to be in the moment with me, loving and clear.The more I’ve learned true history and the historical roots of slavery in various monarchies—a hierarchy founded in the belief that monarchists are superior beings directly descended from God and therefore others must obey them for their own good—the more I’ve been baffled by the insanity that this was accepted by enough people to have it exist and grow into doctrine of Manifest Destiny that made genocide, slavery, torture, and all manner of cruelty rational.I watched Harry and Meghan’s interview with Oprah and found myself alone in my interest: to hear from an outlier the true psychology and cost of the distorted values of a monarchy. I was on the edge of my couch as Harry described a family in shackles, constricted, dependent on the press for its existence, on constant edge and undermining one another in a desperate performance to survive. Again, I found myself exclaiming: This is nuts! And yet most people I heard from only wanted gossip on royalty or were judgmental that somebody so privileged was whining. What?! I wanted to scream. Don’t you see he is telling us our history—how we came to be and the insanity that birthed it?It was only because I wanted to know more from an apparently sane person who just wants to be free that I read this memoir. When I took it out of the library, the check-out woman smiled and said, “Oh, some royal intrigue!” I thought about just nodding, but instead answered, “No. I really want to understand about the monarchy.” She looked puzzled, then responded, “I hope you get whatever you want out of it.”Spare starts off as you might expect. You get a heavy dose of the current discomfort between Harry and his brother and father, then jumpcut to the past and dealing with his mother’s death with complete submersion into the day-to-day life of a royal family member, boarding school, etc. It’s interesting and I thought how much I wouldn’t like having to live that way, always in the public eye, but since I don’t really care about royals, I got a little bored . . . until in the aftermath of his mother’s death, Harry accompanies his father to South Africa where he attends a lecture about a legendary battle between Britain and the Zulus in 1879, and Harry suddenly injects the sanity I was reading for: he says the war was “a source of pride for many Britons, . . [it] was the outgrowth of imperialism, colonialism, nationalism—in short, theft. Great Britain was trespassing, invading a sovereign nation and trying to steal it, meaning the precious blood of Britain’s finest lads had been wasted that day . . . . But I was too young: I heard him and also didn’t hear. Maybe I’d seen the movie Zulu too many times, maybe I’d waged too many pretend battles with my toy Redcoats. I had a view of battle, of Britain, which didn’t permit new facts. So I zoomed in on the bits about manly courage, and British power, and when I should’ve been horrified, I was inspired.” (33–34)This, to me, tells the whole story of the whole mess: truth vs. our love of the stories we’re accustomed to. Our love of drama that turns some people into “other”—be it into superior beings who will protect us or whose lives we can consume like a bowl of sweets because we fancy it is so romantic or exotic, or beings who are treated as property. Harry was twelve when he had his response to this story of theft, but his qualification as an adult gave me hope that I would learn something of value in his memoir—because he has obviously learned something different from what he was conditioned to believe. And in the next few pages, when he displayed his capacity to see the bird’s-eye-view absurdity of a grown man frantically dinging a little bell in his boarding school’s cafeteria to quiet a roomful of chatting boys who couldn’t hear him, I settled down for a good read. And he began delivering: After the press makes great hay out of him breaking his thumb, he blurts, “Centuries ago royal men and women were considered divine; now they were insects. What fun, to pluck their wings.” (46) Harry is experiencing the flip side of the distortion that began our heinous history, and he was a child! I share his outrage. I want to scream the obvious adult bird’s eye view: If you idealize people, if you proliferate lies of superiority, eventually the distortion will flip! Nobody is royal. Nobody is superior or more entitled than anybody else! Yes, we are all different, we have different levels of intelligence and physical capabilities, but nobody deserves a higher place in a hierarchical system than anyone else! However, despite the occasional seasoning of insights, Spare turned out to be mostly a basic memoir that probably will appeal primarily to people who idealize royals, allowing them (the readers) to be moved, shocked, or outraged (depending on their own situations) that royals are just people who do stupid things like everybody else. For me it was the long story of a normal guy—a middling student, a gregarious hunter who was also so hunted that he found peace in being a professional soldier with comrades at war (this takes up a substantial part of the book and would probably be better appreciated by vets than the general reading public). He is a fairly young man who already has lived an extraordinarily huge life, a guy who in other circumstances would not stand out in a crowd, however he has been born into an abnormal family that allowed him unparalleled privilege, educational opportunities, and travel, but all of it in a bizarre fishbowl world [“fancy captivity” (199)] where the public’s scrutiny and fascination with him had zero to do with who he was or anything he’d done. From this distorting magnifying glass of their vision, courtesy of the “paps” (more on the paparazzi in a second), the only options were to burn up (he suffers panic attacks), contort himself into something untenable for the rest of his existence, go numb, or try to escape. I can relate to Harry’s panic attacks. I relate to him (although his and his family’s enjoyment of killing animals for sport twisted my stomach; but hey, we all have contradictions). I’m grateful that he has exposed the insanity and symbiosis of the royal life and the carnivorous press. I admire his decision to work on himself and then to share it with others—another act of soldiering. I hope that writing this memoir was deeply therapeutic, and I wish him and his family well and hope they eventually get to live as close to normal (whatever that is) lives as is possible. But I profoundly disagree with his disconnect between everything he has experienced and a monarchy that was sick, is sick, and deserves to be laid to rest. On page 386 he writes: “My problem has never been with the monarchy, not the concept of monarchy. It’s been with the press and the sick relationship that’s evolved between it and the Palace.” To me, this is an amazing blind spot. Particularly since a few pages later he realizes, during a fight with his brother: “But now I saw that even our finest moments, and my best memories, somehow involved death. Our lives were built on death, our brightest days shadowed by it. . . . we steeped ourselves in it. We christened and crowned, graduated and married, passed out and passed over our beloveds’ bones. Windsor Castle itself was a tomb, the walls filled with ancestors.” (399)Ultimately, this book is very moving and it ends with the death of his beloved “Granny,” the Queen. And I found myself wondering: as he matures further, will he one day realize he can love his Granny but decry the imbalances that gave birth to her position as a direct descendant of God in a monarchy?Now, time for one more personal story: It was a night of what became known as “wilding” in New York City—the night of the infamous “Central Park jogger” rape. I was walking home from my night job in a law office. It was about 11 p.m., and as I hit the Columbus Circle corner of Broadway and Central Park South, I was suddenly—within a second—surrounded by boys. And I mean children, 13- and 14-year-olds. They glommed onto me like bees. Most of them were shorter than I was, laughing and grabbing at my body. But one was my height—5’3”—but at least 30 pounds heavier, a big guy! I will never forget his face, three inches away from mine, grinning as he grabbed for my crotch. He was evil. I blocked him with an oversized purse, but I couldn’t move, completely boxed in, and he liked that. The boys were Black. An older white man on the corner saw the whole thing and didn’t make a move to do anything. As fast as the boys had swarmed me, they disappeared—probably off into Central Park across the street.As I read Harry’s stories of a life being swarmed by men with flashing cameras, I shuddered, reliving that night. Just imagine if this were your everyday existence.I hope eventually there will be no more monarchies and that all of us will evolve into beings who see ourselves and one another with egality. What a party that will be.Show more",4,I have never believed in the validity of hierarchies of importance and entitlement I could not have explained this to you as a very young child but that is when

for he says the war was a source of pride for many Britons   it was the outgrowth of imperialism colonialism nationalismin short theft Great Britain was trespassing invading a sovereign nation and trying to steal it meaning the precious blood of Britains finest lads had been wasted that day     But I was too young I heard him and also didnt hear Maybe Id seen the movie Zulu too many times maybe Id waged too many pretend battles with my toy Redcoats I had a view of battle of Britain which didnt permit new facts So I zoomed in on the bits about manly courage and British power and when I shouldve been horrified I was inspired 3334This to me tells the whole story of the whole mess truth vs our love of the stories were accustomed to Our love of drama that turns some people into otherbe it into superior beings who will protect us or whose lives we can consume like a bowl of sweets because we fancy it is so romantic or exotic or beings who are treated as property Harry was twelve when he had his response to this story of theft but his qualification as an adult gave me hope that I would learn something of value in his memoirbecause he has obviously learned something different from what he was conditioned to believe And in the next few pages when he displayed his capacity to see the birdseyeview absurdity of a grown man frantically dinging a little bell in his boarding schools cafeteria to quiet a roomful of chatting boys who couldnt hear him I settled down for a good read And he began delivering After the press makes great hay out of him breaking his thumb he blurts Centuries ago royal men and women were considered divine now they were insects What fun to pluck their wings 46 Harry is experiencing the flip side of the distortion that began our heinous history and he was a child I share his outrage I want to scream the obvious adult birds eye view If you idealize people if you proliferate lies of superiority eventually the distortion will flip Nobody is royal Nobody is superior or more entitled than anybody else Yes we are all different we have different levels of intelligence and physical capabilities but nobody deserves a higher place in a hierarchical system than anyone else However despite the occasional seasoning of insights Spare turned out to be mostly a basic memoir that probably will appeal primarily to people who idealize royals allowing them the readers to be moved shocked or outraged depending on their own situations that royals are just people who do stupid things like everybody else For me it was the long story of a normal guya middling student a gregarious hunter who was also so hunted that he found peace in being a professional soldier with comrades at war this takes up a substantial part of the book and would probably be better appreciated by vets than the general reading public He is a fairly young man who already has lived an extraordinarily huge life a guy who in other circumstances would not stand out in a crowd however he has been born into an abnormal family that allowed him unparalleled privilege educational opportunities and travel but all of it in a bizarre fishbowl world fancy captivity 199 where the publics scrutiny and fascination with him had zero to do with who he was or anything hed done From this distorting magnifying glass of their vision courtesy of the paps more on the paparazzi in a second the only options were to burn up he suffers panic attacks contort himself into something untenable for the rest of his existence go numb or try to escape I can relate to Harrys panic attacks I relate to him although his and his familys enjoyment of killing animals for sport twisted my stomach but hey we all have contradictions Im grateful that he has exposed the insanity and symbiosis of the royal life and the carnivorous press I admire his decision to work on himself and then to share it with othersanother act of soldiering I hope that writing this memoir was deeply therapeutic and I wish him and his family well and hope they eventually get to live as close to normal whatever that is lives as is possible But I profoundly disagree with his disconnect between everything he has experienced and a monarchy that was sick is sick and deserves to be laid to rest On page 386 he writes My problem has never been with the monarchy not the concept of monarchy Its been with the press and the sick relationship thats evolved between it and the Palace To me this is an amazing blind spot Particularly since a few pages later he realizes during a fight with his brother But now I saw that even our finest moments and my best memories somehow involved death Our lives were built on death our brightest days shadowed by it    we steeped ourselves in it We christened and crowned graduated and married passed out and passed over our beloveds bones Windsor Castle itself was a tomb the walls filled with ancestors 399Ultimately this book is very moving and it ends with the death of his beloved Granny the Queen And I found myself wondering as he matures further will he one day realize he can love his Granny but decry the imbalances that gave birth to her position as a direct descendant of God in a monarchyNow time for one more personal story It was a night of what became known as wilding in New York Citythe night of the infamous Central Park jogger rape I was walking home from my night job in a law office It was about 11 pm and as I hit the Columbus Circle corner of Broadway and Central Park South I was suddenlywithin a secondsurrounded by boys And I mean children 13 and 14yearolds They glommed onto me like bees Most of them were shorter than I was laughing and grabbing at my body But one was my height53but at least 30 pounds heavier a big guy I will never forget his face three inches away from mine grinning as he grabbed for my crotch He was evil I blocked him with an oversized purse but I couldnt move completely boxed in and he liked that The boys were Black An older white man on the corner saw the whole thing and didnt make a move to do anything As fast as the boys had swarmed me they disappearedprobably off into Central Park across the streetAs I read Harrys stories of a life being swarmed by men with flashing cameras I shuddered reliving that night Just imagine if this were your everyday existenceI hope eventually there will be no more monarchies and that all of us will evolve into beings who see ourselves and one another with egality What a party that will beShow more
Rating 4 out of 5,"3.75 ⭐️’s rounded up.I’m from the US and even though we are not under English government a lot of us Americans do follow the lives of the monarchy. I’m not really one of the Royal watchers myself, it just never really interested me. But I do remember watching Princess Diana and Prince Charles’ union on TV as a little girl, I thought it was so extravagant and beautiful and looked like a living breathing fairy tale. I was also deeply saddened at Diana’s death and remember Elton John’s beautiful tribute as he sang Candle in the Wind. And I have to admit the scandal of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry has piqued my passing interest, but I’ve never been fully invested in their story until Spare came out. There are 3 parts to the book and Harry starts out by looking at his English estate, saying goodbye to what he thought was going to be the forever home for Meghan, himself and their children. He’s so very torn but he wants to protect his family so they are fleeing to America in hopes they can have a “normal” life without the constant badgering of the Paps through the aide of members ingrained in the Royal Family Camp. Part 1 Chronicles Harry’s childhood all the way up to his enlisting in the military. He talks about bits of time with his mother. How it was “living” with his father after she passed. Most of the time he was away at school, very rarely spending time with his father especially after he married Camilla. And the saddest part of all that he used to think that Diana was actually in hiding instead of passed on so she could be free of the paparazzi. He was undoubtedly very traumatized and he doesn’t seem remember a lot. I think Harry being known as a “troubled” kid had a lot to do with Diana’s death. And to hear him tell it there were a lot of false spins on his life and a few mistakes that were not done to be problematic, he was unaware of how inappropriate his actions really were (like the time Harry dressed up as a Nazi Officer for a costume themed Birthday Party).Part 2 is about Harry’s military life and after. He was very much married to serving in the British Military and it was hard for him to retire and to give it up. When he came home he was troubled from his time of service and still not properly dealing with the loss of his mother. He had PTSD along with crippling bouts of anxiety which had him housebound for the better part of a year. He had a hard time at social events and when he finally tried to get help he was given medications without suitable therapy. Part 3 is all about Harry and Meghan. How they met, how they fell in love. How hard the paparazzi were on both, especially Meghan when their relationship was found out. The ups and downs Meghan faced with the press when she married Harry, all of it. I had no idea things were so hard for her, at one point she thought about ending her own life, it was that bad. Also per Harry a lot of the info about Meghan being so difficult was false and spread with malice. The several things that I loved about this book was Harry’s love for Africa and Meghan. He spoke about Africa with such love you just know that it’s a second beloved home for him. I don’t know anything about Meghan Markle but I feel that if a gentle soul like Harry could fall that hard for her then she can’t be the evil person that so many have tried to make her out to be. There is not a lot of salacious gossip in this book. I learned a couple things I don’t think the Royal Family would like the public to know but nothing huge by any means. So gossip lovers beware this is not that type of book. I was shocked to learn what Spare actually meant, Harry was the considered the spare to the heir (Prince William) all his life. How hard that must have been for Harry to be known as that all his life?!The main thing that irked me about this book was how abruptly the chapters ended. He was telling a story and then bam it just ended. It was a bit frustrating. Harry readily admits he is not a scholar so don’t expect a great piece of literature it’s just informative, and interesting imo. Spare was a genuine and personal telling chronicling the good and bad of Harry’s life as a Royal, brother, son, grandson and later husband and father. It was told with humility and true feelings (I felt) and I appreciated learning more about Harry and his side of things. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good Autobiography or wants to learn a little more info on Prince Harry and the Royal Family. And I highly suggest the audio, Prince Harry reads it himself and I love his voice and English Accent!Show more",4,375 s rounded upIm from the US and even though we are not under English government a lot of us Americans do follow the lives of the monarchy Im not really one of the Royal watchers myself it just never really interested me But I do remember watching Princess Diana and Prince Charles union on TV as a little girl I thought it was so extravagant and beautiful and looked like a living breathing fairy tale I was also deeply saddened at Dianas death and remember Elton Johns beautiful tribute as he sang Candle in the Wind And I have to admit the scandal of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry has piqued my passing interest but Ive never been fully invested in their story until Spare came out There are 3 parts to the book and Harry starts out by looking at his English estate saying goodbye to what he thought was going to be the forever home for Meghan himself and their children Hes so very torn but he wants to protect his family so they are fleeing to America in hopes they can have a normal life without the constant badgering of the Paps through the aide of members ingrained in the Royal Family Camp Part 1 Chronicles Harrys childhood all the way up to his enlisting in the military He talks about bits of time with his mother How it was living with his father after she passed Most of the time he was away at school very rarely spending time with his father especially after he married Camilla And the saddest part of all that he used to think that Diana was actually in hiding instead of passed on so she could be free of the paparazzi He was undoubtedly very traumatized and he doesnt seem remember a lot I think Harry being known as a troubled kid had a lot to do with Dianas death And to hear him tell it there were a lot of false spins on his life and a few mistakes that were not done to be problematic he was unaware of how inappropriate his actions really were like the time Harry dressed up as a Nazi Officer for a costume themed Birthday PartyPart 2 is about Harrys military life and after He was very much married to serving in the British Military and it was hard for him to retire and to give it up When he came home he was troubled from his time of service and still not properly dealing with the loss of his mother He had PTSD along with crippling bouts of anxiety which had him housebound for the better part of a year He had a hard time at social events and when he finally tried to get help he was given medications without suitable therapy Part 3 is all about Harry and Meghan How they met how they fell in love How hard the paparazzi were on both especially Meghan when their relationship was found out The ups and downs Meghan faced with the press when she married Harry all of it I had no idea things were so hard for her at one point she thought about ending her own life it was that bad Also per Harry a lot of the info about Meghan being so difficult was false and spread with malice The several things that I loved about this book was Harrys love for Africa and Meghan He spoke about Africa with such love you just know that its a second beloved home for him I dont know anything about Meghan Markle but I feel that if a gentle soul like Harry could fall that hard for her then she cant be the evil person that so many have tried to make her out to be There is not a lot of salacious gossip in this book I learned a couple things I dont think the Royal Family would like the public to know but nothing huge by any means So gossip lovers beware this is not that type of book I was shocked to learn what Spare actually meant Harry was the considered the spare to the heir Prince William all his life How hard that must have been for Harry to be known as that all his lifeThe main thing that irked me about this book was how abruptly the chapters ended He was telling a story and then bam it just ended It was a bit frustrating Harry readily admits he is not a scholar so dont expect a great piece of literature its just informative and interesting imo Spare was a genuine and personal telling chronicling the good and bad of Harrys life as a Royal brother son grandson and later husband and father It was told with humility and true feelings I felt and I appreciated learning more about Harry and his side of things I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good Autobiography or wants to learn a little more info on Prince Harry and the Royal Family And I highly suggest the audio Prince Harry reads it himself and I love his voice and English AccentShow more

And bitter. And sad. I’m conflicted. For all my personal misgivings about him, I think he should’ve given this manuscript to his therapist rather than having it published for the entire world to see. It’s clear this man is not well. On the other hand, I’d like to scrub my eyeballs off for the number of times he refers to his penis. Never wanted to know if he was circumcised.

Rating 5 out of 5,"You all know how I rate my memoirs, and the go to for me is how open the subject is about their life while telling us (the readers) their story. For me, this is really good (5 stars) but I honestly cannot favorite it. That's because reading through this once was a lot and I don't see me re-reading this like I did Gabrielle Union's memoir or even Barack Obama's. Also kudos to the ghostwriter (JR Moehringeron) who has helped many other memoirs get birthed. I have heard he is really good, and I am realizing this is the first time I have read one of the books he helped ghostwrite. I am going to track down the other ones to compare to just see how he handled those subjects too. I also do want to say something. I feel badly that I was reacting to a lot of the UK press (tabloids) about pull quotes from the book without reading the whole thing. I was highly annoyed when I started reading and got the context for everything. For those who love or hate him, I think they will be surprised on a at times very straightforward, funny, and sometimes somber look at Prince Harry's life as the Spare. Also this book follows him from childhood to his leaving the Royal Family as a full time working Royal. [Ahem, don't get me started on working Royals...look I am American, I think the whole thing is weird.]Biggest thing is that I was surprised how and his brother, Prince William were raised. I would just have guessed the ""modern monarchy"" wouldn't be into the heir and spare stuff, but they were. Even to the point both brothers were forced to share a room, but Harry got only a tiny portion of it. At times in the book I wanted to ask were these people poor, but we know they are not, so there's something else going on there that I am just very curious about. But I would say that the biggest revelation in this book is how much Prince Harry does love his family. I felt at times he was trying to excuse things that were done or said because he's trying to still wrap his head around it. There's affection for his father, and I think just sadness that his brother was ""taken in"" by people who were believing bad things and that none of these people knew how to communicate without fights getting started. I think the biggest thing to read is that even though Prince William was in the end winning (he's the heir) he still needed to make Prince Harry feel small throughout their lives together. I honestly am kind of more curious about that than anything. I mean there's a whole thing about Prince William not liking that Prince Harry was allowed to wear a bear. That he wanted to take away some of the foundations/initiatives he started, etc. There is sibling rivalry, but then there is whatever this mess was and currently is. And I don't want to listen to anymore boys will be boys things. My brothers and I all love each other. We all fought when we were younger. But I think us losing our parents at the age we did tied us together more tightly than most families. I think that was the way with Prince Harry and Prince William. I was also surprised to read more about his wife, Meghan. Because, I don't know, I felt like she was a fragile woman that needed protection, but this is a woman who has/had boundaries and refused to let Harry walk all over him or his family. I honestly mumbled good for her a few times while reading this. Also, let's call Prince Harry out here. He did a terrible freaking job briefing his now wife on his family. I think she assumed these were just rich people by any other name, but were in the end, a good family she was marrying into. And then you realize these people actually have to bow to each other in private. [Another aside, I would have told Prince Harry the sex is good, but I am out like months into this mess. But I don't have a lot of time for people's insanity.] And there's a whole lot on the UK press in this. And honestly if you want a villain in the book, it's them. I think Prince Harry is a lot more flexible with some of the incidents that were described. He doesn't seem too pressed about them. And I think sometimes he was just like can we all just move on. But I think he seems himself as the dragonslayer of the press to get his family back. There's no doubt there's an invisible contract between the Royal Family and the UK press. You have to be blind to not see it. Especially since they all have anonymous Royal sources. And a few times things got dropped (Meghan making Kate cry---FYI didn't happen) which you know someone in the family had to have told the press. It's a whole other mess. How can you be open and a family when you have to worry that you are going to be used to deflect away any negative attention the family is getting at that moment in time. I guess it's weird to me since the American Beltway media is a whole thing with my career. And then you have the major newspapers and local papers. You can get some media like Fox with an obvious conservative bent who also went on a whole other Trump apology tour when Donald Trump was President. But I can't imagine any journalist not digging in when a family member was being tossed to the wolves constantly to deflect from the crap someone else was doing at the time.

Rating 5 out of 5,"I'm not gonna lie to y'all and make it sound like when it came to my attention late in 2022 that Harry was coming out with a memoir in 2023 that my ears didn't immediately perk up. I mean it wasn't completely out of left field, at that point he'd already given a couple high profile interviews since relocating to Southern California and the production company with Meghan was starting to pump out content for Spotify and they had their Netflix deal in place. Looking back it seems only logical that a book being rolled out would be the next logical step.Then the tweets started rolling out and the headlines with excerpts from the book started to flood my tl and it felt almost impossible to avoid. I think that I wound up doing a pretty good job of that. It did get easier to avoid once I gave up reading this book expressly for content creation means and just to savor his story first and have the vlog be more of an afterthought.Partly as an American, but also a person who spent most of the time when Harry was dominating the tabloids as far from the internet as a person can be I only had the vague idea of Harry as a party boy, something he tangles with in detail in the book. I also vaguely knew that he had some military service thanks to that gif of him leaving the interview and running toward helicopters in the background. So going in I doubt that I would have predicated that so much of the book would be devoted to his time in Afghanistan. Sure, there's the stuff about Harry getting into trouble in school that you'd expect. Anecdotes about the way he was unable to process that his mother was actually dead and this invented life he crafted for her being undercover some where. It's less a book that's taking aim at tearing down the Monarchy, though anyone that's ever seen any of the interviews he's given as a result of his marriage to Meghan would never have assumed that that would be a stance his book takes. Instead, Spare is a look at the ways that Harry has long tried to carve out space for himself, the things in his life that he views as what make him like any other person. Honestly, the portion of the book where he does detail his time in Afghanistan would probably resonate with a lot of people in his age range in a post 9/11 world looking to be a part of something greater than themselves; perhaps even magnified for a person who has been in Harry's shoes.In some ways this does feel like an introductory memoir, Harry trying to reintroduce himself to a world that where he has long been defined by his family and the tabloids. It's not a book where Harry is attempting to interrogate all of the systems in place that have shaped his life and how by tearing them down we could create something better in their wake, but I don't think that is any fault of the book. I know that he's pushing 40, and the world is on the verge of ecological disaster, but I do think that down the road he could publish something closer to the text that people thought this would be, where he does burn bridges and salt the Earth, but for now I am more than happy to meet Henry where he's at and enjoy the parts of himself that he decided to share with us here.Show more",5,Im not gonna lie to yall and make it sound like when it came to my attention late in 2022 that Harry was coming out with a memoir in 2023 that my ears didnt immediately perk up I mean it wasnt completely out of left field at that point hed already given a couple high profile interviews since relocating to Southern California and the production company with Meghan was starting to pump out content for Spotify and they had their Netflix deal in place Looking back it seems only logical that a book being rolled out would be the next logical stepThen the tweets started rolling out and the headlines with excerpts from the book started to flood my tl and it felt almost impossible to avoid I think that I wound up doing a pretty good job of that It did get easier to avoid once I gave up reading this book expressly for content creation means and just to savor his story first and have the vlog be more of an afterthoughtPartly as an American but also a person who spent most of the time when Harry was dominating the tabloids as far from the internet as a person can be I only had the vague idea of Harry as a party boy something he tangles with in detail in the book I also vaguely knew that he had some military service thanks to that gif of him leaving the interview and running toward helicopters in the background So going in I doubt that I would have predicated that so much of the book would be devoted to his time in Afghanistan Sure theres the stuff about Harry getting into trouble in school that youd expect Anecdotes about the way he was unable to process that his mother was actually dead and this invented life he crafted for her being undercover some where Its less a book thats taking aim at tearing down the Monarchy though anyone thats ever seen any of the interviews hes given as a result of his marriage to Meghan would never have assumed that that would be a stance his book takes Instead Spare is a look at the ways that Harry has long tried to carve out space for himself the things in his life that he views as what make him like any other person Honestly the portion of the book where he does detail his time in Afghanistan would probably resonate with a lot of people in his age range in a post 911 world looking to be a part of something greater than themselves perhaps even magnified for a person who has been in Harrys shoesIn some ways this does feel like an introductory memoir Harry trying to reintroduce himself to a world that where he has long been defined by his family and the tabloids Its not a book where Harry is attempting to interrogate all of the systems in place that have shaped his life and how by tearing them down we could create something better in their wake but I dont think that is any fault of the book I know that hes pushing 40 and the world is on the verge of ecological disaster but I do think that down the road he could publish something closer to the text that people thought this would be where he does burn bridges and salt the Earth but for now I am more than happy to meet Henry where hes at and enjoy the parts of himself that he decided to share with us hereShow more
Rating 2 out of 5,"2.5.Some parts were quite boring (first two thirds) because I was here for the dirty secrets the prince was supposed to reveal. Even though the juiciest bits were all revealed in the media, by reading the book I got some context for the things that were widely discussed and joked about (and then some of the stuff can be understood differently and not as the media portrays). It might be a persuasive read, especially if you have not picked a side in the royal squabble and seldom read news about them, except where they attended and what they wore for the occasion, however, some things were stupidly cringy (frostbitten penis) and damn awful, to put it midly (Harry put cream on his already mentioned frostbitten penis and the same cream was used by Diana, so he thought of her at that moment). This book is getting ripped apart by fact chechers as it should.My two cents: there must some true stories here, however, he definitely has a blind spot for Meghan who is absolutely perfect, according to him.Writing: it definitely feels like there were at least two or three writers involved here. The third part about Meghan - gods, who wrote that? Harry says he knows nothing about fashion, yet remembers every outfit Meg wore to the detail (of course, she looked ""perfect""). Spirituality: super weird stuff throughtout the book, if you ask me, because if I were to meet a leopard on a safari, I am not going to think it is a sign from my supposedly dead mother.Conclusion: Harry is a damaged kid still, the royal family is dysfuntionctional, the palace is a wiper's nest, Kate and Willian are not as nice as they seem, paps are everywhere and endanger everyone's life and freedoms.This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review",2,25Some parts were quite boring first two thirds because I was here for the dirty secrets the prince was supposed to reveal Even though the juiciest bits were all revealed in the media by reading the book I got some context for the things that were widely discussed and joked about and then some of the stuff can be understood differently and not as the media portrays It might be a persuasive read especially if you have not picked a side in the royal squabble and seldom read news about them except where they attended and what they wore for the occasion however some things were stupidly cringy frostbitten penis and damn awful to put it midly Harry put cream on his already mentioned frostbitten penis and the same cream was used by Diana so he thought of her at that moment This book is getting ripped apart by fact chechers as it shouldMy two cents there must some true stories here however he definitely has a blind spot for Meghan who is absolutely perfect according to himWriting it definitely feels like there were at least two or three writers involved here The third part about Meghan  gods who wrote that Harry says he knows nothing about fashion yet remembers every outfit Meg wore to the detail of course she looked perfect Spirituality super weird stuff throughtout the book if you ask me because if I were to meet a leopard on a safari I am not going to think it is a sign from my supposedly dead motherConclusion Harry is a damaged kid still the royal family is dysfuntionctional the palace is a wipers nest Kate and Willian are not as nice as they seem paps are everywhere and endanger everyones life and freedomsThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilersShow full review

Rating 5 out of 5,"This book is well written and Harry does not list a co-author. It seems that most people think he had a ghost writer - whatever, the book reads well, and we are led to believe that Harry was not the most attentive student, until it came to the military or war stuff, flying and managing who was shooting whom and where. So, perhaps someone wrote the book for him with his real telling of the story. It was a quick easy read. I loved this book because it is down to earth, does not disclose any military secrets but does give us a sense of the evil (rot) in the company (the royal family). Harry does not seem to dislike being the spare but he disikes the betrayal of his family. At one point, he wrote Queen Elizabeth personally regarding the security of his family and the personal attacks from the press. In a later family meeting with the Queen and her loyal helpers, he makes reference to the letter and the Queen says she never saw the letter. She looks at her loyal aides and both deny that she ever got the letter. So, Harry confronts a lot of lies from family members and their aides. That is hard to do. Harry tells of his absolute pain when his mother was killed, having to walk down the street behind her coffin and he was only 8 years old and no one to comfort him. In this book, Harry is also confronting the lies of his father and brother - they do this and welcome allies in the press. Harry never worked with the press on anything and spent his life hiding from them. Too late, he realized that his brother and father have newspaper people who plant stories for them. This is a book about a little boy, brokenhearted that his mother is dead (for a long time he thinks she is just hiding out from the press), who was always the extra and loyal - never in on the plans, about his maturing, learning to love the disadvantaged, the ill, following in his mother's footsteps and finally falling in love with a real person and becoming a father. I realize this is all his point of view but it is HIS biography. He shows us that the monarchy is dying in Great Britain - his grandmother was old and worn at the end and allowed evil to flourish, his father is selfish and unwise in almost every aspect and his brother is also selfish and a fool, never gets the point. I hope that I live long enough to see Harry come into his own and the outdated British Manarchy dies.

Rating 5 out of 5,"First of all, I'm not into the British Royal Family, neither am I fan of Harry and Meghan. I don't read tabloid news papers. At the same time, I have never watched ""Suits"". The only thing is that I went to the Kensington Palace on the day of Charles and Diana's wedding in 1981. I was a Japanese student taking a summer course that summer. Because of that connection, I was really sad about what happened to Diana. But, I didn't pay any special attentions to the Royal Family after that.I read this book because of my work. To be honest with you, it's a bit boring until Harry met Meghan (part 3 of the book). But, you need to read part 1 and 2 in order to understand why Harry decided to go public in the end. Without reading it, nobody should criticize Harry's action including writing this book.You may think Harry is not totally believable. I get it. However, no matter who it is, every single author of a memoir is unreliable narrator. They tell their life story the way they want readers to know. As far as the unreliable narrators are concerned, Prince Harry felt more reliable than many I have read. You can tell that he tried to be honest. Actually, it's a well-written book since the publisher used a great Ghostwriter, J.R. Moehringer. Moehringer got a great mixture of good literately writing and Harry's own voice. It's even poetic sometimes.What this memoir really tells you is that the heir and the spare are raised differently in the British Royal family and it could be a real problem for spare. Think about Princess Margaret and Prince Andrew. They were both raised as the spares, and they both ended up having so many problems. Young Harry was wild and made so many mistakes, but he was also a lonely lost kid who wanted warm loving parents and a life purpose. Nobody gave these important things to the troubled ""spares"". If they were the ordinary family, you could easily say they ware dysfunctional. The bigger problem is that this dysfunctional family is surrounded by several strong groups of people who are more racist and toxic. And they make the family's situation much worse.If someone has to risk everything they have to leave their family, I strongly believe that the family is the problem. Not the other way around. I don't know anything about Harry and I don't think Harry and Meghan are perfect. Nobody is. But, I truly appreciate one thing; Harry chose to protect his wife. For that reason, I cheer for Harry. I wish him and his family well. I don't think Harry's book will change his haters' opinions. However, this book makes a strong case for many people that the British Monarch might be quite outdated and irrelevant.My Newsweek Japan review: https://www.newsweekjapan.jp/watanabe...4.5 stars.Show more",5,First of all Im not into the British Royal Family neither am I fan of Harry and Meghan I dont read tabloid news papers At the same time I have never watched Suits The only thing is that I went to the Kensington Palace on the day of Charles and Dianas wedding in 1981 I was a Japanese student taking a summer course that summer Because of that connection I was really sad about what happened to Diana But I didnt pay any special attentions to the Royal Family after thatI read this book because of my work To be honest with you its a bit boring until Harry met Meghan part 3 of the book But you need to read part 1 and 2 in order to understand why Harry decided to go public in the end Without reading it nobody should criticize Harrys action including writing this bookYou may think Harry is not totally believable I get it However no matter who it is every single author of a memoir is unreliable narrator They tell their life story the way they want readers to know As far as the unreliable narrators are concerned Prince Harry felt more reliable than many I have read You can tell that he tried to be honest Actually its a wellwritten book since the publisher used a great Ghostwriter JR Moehringer Moehringer got a great mixture of good literately writing and Harrys own voice Its even poetic sometimesWhat this memoir really tells you is that the heir and the spare are raised differently in the British Royal family and it could be a real problem for spare Think about Princess Margaret and Prince Andrew They were both raised as the spares and they both ended up having so many problems Young Harry was wild and made so many mistakes but he was also a lonely lost kid who wanted warm loving parents and a life purpose Nobody gave these important things to the troubled spares If they were the ordinary family you could easily say they ware dysfunctional The bigger problem is that this dysfunctional family is surrounded by several strong groups of people who are more racist and toxic And they make the familys situation much worseIf someone has to risk everything they have to leave their family I strongly believe that the family is the problem Not the other way around I dont know anything about Harry and I dont think Harry and Meghan are perfect Nobody is But I truly appreciate one thing Harry chose to protect his wife For that reason I cheer for Harry I wish him and his family well I dont think Harrys book will change his haters opinions However this book makes a strong case for many people that the British Monarch might be quite outdated and irrelevantMy Newsweek Japan review httpswwwnewsweekjapanjpwatanabe45 starsShow more
Rating 4 out of 5,"I'm really amused that he's being credited as Prince Harry, like is it going to say Copyright Prince Harry? And now I'm curious about what the protocol is for royal memoirs.EDIT 2023/01/16: To answer my own question, the copyright belongs to ""Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex"". Which then leads to a different question of whether duchies are always used to distinguish different members of the royal family with the same name if they're not monarchs who get numbers. (The repeated names is a very Targaryen problem, although obviously I know the inspiration was the other way around.)As for the actual book -- I reserve 5 stars for my absolute favourites, but for entertainment value alone, this makes a very compelling case for 5 stars. He really put his entire Harrussy into it (#SorryNotSorry), like he laid it ALLLLLLL out. I know this is only one side of the story, but he does have credibility because the world has witnessed all of this playing out. The short chapters definitely helped move things along in a quick pace, and he'll just drop these revelations and move on. (Other than the frostbit penis, which showed up so much more than I anticipated.) Sunlight is the best disinfectant, and hopefully having said his piece, he and Meghan will be able to heal and find, well, peace.

Rating 1 out of 5,"People should also not rate 5 stars for an unreleased book either. Harry was someone I gather did poorly in school, now he writes a book? I would urge people NOT to promote his and his wife's egoes by buying it. Moreover he's making money for ""charity"" by throwing his family including our late Queen under the bus. No self respecting person would do this. Apparently this book was in the works when the Queen was dying and he still releases this abomination (after second thoughts apparently). Besides, does the title of his book indicate he is talking about the weather? What his family ate on a day to day basis? Of course not. The Royal family is NOT racist and never has been, and there's plenty of evidence to support it. The editorial to this book is just laughable.

Chapter 11 goes into great detail and gives reasons as to why Prince Harry is so angry. Harry tells of yearly trips to his local AMF bowling alley on his birthday and how every year he never got the strike he so desperately desired. Even with the bumpers up he just couldn’t get all the pins down on his first go. This happened every year from ages 6 to 15. I think people need to read this before being so quick to judge.

Rating 4 out of 5,"Never seen a book receive such harsh critiques and cause this much controversy, even before it’s publication date. I wanted all the gossip ☕️ and to hear Harry’s side of everything, so I had this on preorder from the first moment I was able to. First and foremost, it’s abundantly clear that Harry just wants to protect his wife and children from the misinformation, racism and awful lies spread about himself and Meghan by the British Press. He knew that his Mother was hounded and chased by paparazzi cars into a Paris tunnel and never made it out alive. Harry’s therapist surmises that part of his is ”still stuck in 1997.”Grief is a fickle thing. Grief impacts everybody in different ways. I can sympathise with the way Harry describes barely having any tangible memories of his late Mother. My grandmother, my Nana, passed away when I was 11 years old and as much as I try to remember her. It escapes me. I feel like this is one of the main reasons why I can’t remember alot of my childhood. I had lived in the same home as her up until her death, she helped raise me and I felt the closest to her in the world. Lady Diana Spencer was killed when I was only 2 years old but my Mother always recalls that when the news flashed on the television and the family was talking about it that I pointed, doe-eyed, at the screen and said “she was a lovely lady.” This surprised them as I struggled with speech (yay autism✌️). I believe that I may have just been parroting what I had heard others say.. but I’d like to think it testament to, an example of, how everybody knew what a wonderful human being Diana truly was. Harry doesn’t want his beloved Meg to suffer the same fate. She reached a crisis point with her mental health when pregnant with their first child, Archie, where she felt like the only way out of the harassment would be to take her own life. Yet, there is still vitriolic hate and lies about her every day on social media and in the British tabloids.Love towards his family is abundantly clear throughout the book, even though he does talk about some difficult times, you can tell this love for his “Pa” and “Willy” never truly waivers. Even though the book does end with him questioning the future of his and William’s relationship in terms of closeness. He doesn’t know what to believe. He had an incredibly special bond with his Granny, the Queen, right up until the end of her life. She seemed incredibly fond of Harry and wanted what was best for him. It seems like any decisions made not in his favour weren’t made by her, but the people surrounding her. There was times where he was even blocked from seeing her by her people after she had agreed to when tensions were high about him and Meghan stepping away from royal duties.Yes, there are moments of this book that can be deemed cringeworthy and oversharing, the ”frostbitten todger” part made me wince lol.

Rating 3 out of 5,"One thing I am sure of, is that the universe does not need another review of this book, but I spent 3 days reading it so you’re getting my hot take anyway. Whatever you think of Harry in the current moment, I think there are some key takeaways that we can mostly agree on.- Clearly deeply traumatised by the death of his mother (unsurprising) and as the book conveys it, his grief wasn’t always supported in the best way by his family.- Pleasantly readable- great work by the ghost writer- A more robust content edit would have been a great idea. There’s a bunch of anecdotes in here that I am not sure any of us needed to know about, and don’t enhance our understanding of “the truth” - Everyone has at least one, often more than one nickname, and I did not care about the innumerate nickname origin stories. - It is a shame that all the pre-publication interviews revealed absolutely everything of interest in this book. - You couldn’t pay me to be a Royal and the British press are trash.- All families are complicated, we all fight with our siblings, our parents don’t always get it right and that never feels nice but it’s part of the roller coaster of being in a family.

Rating 2 out of 5,"I tried to go into this with no expectations and previous biases, but that’s really difficult to do given not only how high profile Prince Harry is, but the nature of his celebrity. Regardless of personal feelings (or perhaps in spite of) I still don’t think this book was very good. In both how it has been put together and the reading experience itself, as well as the actual content. I struggled a lot reading it.I have a bit to say so strap yourself in if you feel like it, but I’ll start with a (sort of) positive. I really do feel for him in some ways. He did have a very strange and in my opinion traumatic childhood despite his insane privilege. Some of the things he dismissively says and jokes about in here were sometimes a bit disturbing. The way the media have treated him (and Meghan especially) is vile. And losing his mother so young while juggling that spotlight must have been hell. Having said that, I still had several issues with ‘Spare’.The first thing that struck me about this book was the writing style. It felt almost as if he was trying to keep it factual and non-fiction, but it also had a strange air of fictional storytelling to it that just made the tone of the book sound strange. His writing at times was clunky and it read as awkward. Some I’d even describe as poor. For instance:- The trees were bare but the air was soft, the sky was grey but the tulips were popping- When I discovered that quotation not too long ago on BrainyQuote.com- Pat wasn’t hot. Pat was cold.- Whoa. Vibe change.Some of the writing being really bad is funny considering he slates a journalist for bad writing at one point, saying he doubts they’ll have a career in writing for long.I also found the pacing of this really hit or miss. Some parts are very quick and snappy, keeping me engaged. Other segments such as his time learning to fly helicopters, were very sluggish. They bored me to tears. I also found the structure and overall chronology of events really jumpy and all over the place, going back and forth quite a bit.I couldn’t grasp who Harry was writing this for. Because it often had the demeanour of an upper class individual at times, clashing with a man trying to seem relatable and ‘normal’ which didn’t work at all for me.- For everyday casual clothes I’d go to TK Maxx, the discount store- She was well educated, I was decidedly not (HUH?)- One: Nando’s chickenAt times when trying to appear humble and down to Earth, he honestly just came across as more of a parody of a person. I don’t know how else to describe it but the way he presented himself felt a little uncomfortable.I also love drama as much as the next person, but some of the information offered here unprovoked was weird at best, disturbing at worst.- Everyone knew everyone’s business, down to who was circumcised and who wasn’t (he says this was called a game of roundheads vs. cavaliers, and later tells us he was snipped as a baby.)- It happened in a grassy field behind a pub (losing his virginity)- One very close mate hired a seamstress to make me a bespoke cock cushionI just think some of this stuff was thrown in for shock value, and none of us needed to hear it from a Prince, or anyone at all really.There was also an alarming amount of attention given to his ‘todger’, which in some contexts was discussed bizarrely.- The smell transported me through time. I felt as if my mother was right there in the room. Then I took a smidge and applied it..down there.- My nether regions were frostnipped as well, and while the ears and cheeks were already healing, the todger wasn’t- What was the universe out to prove by taking my penis at the same moment it took my brother?- My penis was oscillating between extremely sensitive and borderline traumatisedHe circled back to the topic frequently through chapters and couldn’t seem to let it go. I have no idea how he thought it was a) relevant and b) appropriate but it made for a cringeworthy reading experience.It also appeared Harry could never fully take a stance on anything, and he was either obtuse or hypocritical in his discussions throughout. For instance, in the issue with the Nazi costume he shared the blame indirectly with Kate and William. He then later says he ‘hadn’t known enough about the Nazis’ which for someone aged eighteen educated by Eton who knows about the roundheads I find insulting to even contemplate believing. He briefly talks about how horrific the monarchy being built on colonialism and oppression is, but then says he still supports the monarchy, and he’s never had a problem with it or the concept of it. Purposely confusing, and honestly unsurprisingly disappointing.I have more to complain about, and this review is just my condensed thoughts believe it or not.I found it unsettling the way Harry spoke about the war, and about racism. Him saying it will be a ‘relief’ to be in a proper war zone is so ridiculously insensitive and privileged. He also compares murdering people to playing playstation, says they were ‘chess pieces’ instead of people, and was confused at the backlash he received upon revealing to the public he was a murderer. To be so detached from reality and so blind to what you’re saying must be blissful.The P slur is typed repeatedly in this book, ironically while Harry is explaining the trouble he got into for saying it previously. Later in the book, he censors his usage of ‘the N-word’ (as he typed it) so it was outrageous to me he still found the other acceptable to say. He says at one point he was raging that the press calling him lazy was rage inducing, while insinuating in the same sentence the press had also labelled him as stupid, naughty and racist previously which didn’t seem to bother him as much. In his defence that may have just been a result of poor wording in the sentence, but that’s how it read. When discussing the racism Meghan faces in the media he says ‘we’.. Odd choice of word.I feel like Harry’s going to get into even more trouble for the things he revealed about the toxicity and bizarre nature of his family, but I do have to admit the tidbits we do get about the king were hilarious.- You might blunder in as he was doing his headstands (the king)- He performed them daily, in just a pair of boxers, propped against a door- He was always sniffing things- Teddy went everywhere with Pa. It was a pitiful object, with broken arms and dangly threads- Pa likes it when women wear their hair down- Pa didn’t approve of women who wore a lot (makeup)- Deprived of love as a boy, bullied by schoolmatesI swear to an extent this is treasonous, but I think it’s hilarious actually.ANYWAY. That was more of an essay than a review but if you were considering reading this out of curiosity: just stick to the memes online. This was so dry and underwhelming.Show more",2,I tried to go into this with no expectations and previous biases but thats really difficult to do given not only how high profile Prince Harry is but the nature of his celebrity Regardless of personal feelings or perhaps in spite of I still dont think this book was very good In both how it has been put together and the reading experience itself as well as the actual content I struggled a lot reading itI have a bit to say so strap yourself in if you feel like it but Ill start with a sort of positive I really do feel for him in some ways He did have a very strange and in my opinion traumatic childhood despite his insane privilege Some of the things he dismissively says and jokes about in here were sometimes a bit disturbing The way the media have treated him and Meghan especially is vile And losing his mother so young while juggling that spotlight must have been hell Having said that I still had several issues with SpareThe first thing that struck me about this book was the writing style It felt almost as if he was trying to keep it factual and nonfiction but it also had a strange air of fictional storytelling to it that just made the tone of the book sound strange His writing at times was clunky and it read as awkward Some Id even describe as poor For instance The trees were bare but the air was soft the sky was grey but the tulips were popping When I discovered that quotation not too long ago on BrainyQuotecom Pat wasnt hot Pat was cold Whoa Vibe changeSome of the writing being really bad is funny considering he slates a journalist for bad writing at one point saying he doubts theyll have a career in writing for longI also found the pacing of this really hit or miss Some parts are very quick and snappy keeping me engaged Other segments such as his time learning to fly helicopters were very sluggish They bored me to tears I also found the structure and overall chronology of events really jumpy and all over the

Rating 5 out of 5,"Do you follow the Royal Family?Spare by Prince Harry (Audiobook Review)5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐The story of Spare teaches us that every story has two sides. Since I have always followed the Royal Family, I assumed I would have a negative reaction to Prince Harry's story. Updated information revealed that my assumption was incorrect. As I listened, my emotions ranged from laughter to tears to reflection.Prince Harry should be commended for taking the courageous step of being vulnerable to the world. He takes charge of his narrative and does a wonderful job with the writing. I cannot praise it enough. No matter if you're British or American, I recommend listening to this audiobook first before forming your opinion. Listen to it as a story of a boy growing into a man, without the bias you may have heard about Harry from the media. #Spare #PrinceHarry #RandomHouse #bookishcommunity #bookstagramcommunity #blogtour #readingcommunity #Books #bookfriends #booksbooksbooks #booksta #bookstagram #newtobookstagram #bookreview #bookreviews #instabookstagram #bookish #bookishielife #Audible #newtobookstagram #newtoinstaShow more",5,Do you follow the Royal FamilySpare by Prince Harry Audiobook Review5 The story of Spare teaches us that every story has two sides Since I have always followed the Royal Family I assumed I would have a negative reaction to Prince Harrys story Updated information revealed that my assumption was incorrect As I listened my emotions ranged from laughter to tears to reflectionPrince Harry should be commended for taking the courageous step of being vulnerable to the world He takes charge of his narrative and does a wonderful job with the writing I cannot praise it enough No matter if youre British or American I recommend listening to this audiobook first before forming your opinion Listen to it as a story of a boy growing into a man without the bias you may have heard about Harry from the media Spare PrinceHarry RandomHouse bookishcommunity bookstagramcommunity blogtour readingcommunity Books bookfriends booksbooksbooks booksta bookstagram newtobookstagram bookreview bookreviews instabookstagram bookish bookishielife Audible newtobookstagram newtoinstaShow more

Rating 5 out of 5,"Wow, I have a lot of thoughts about this book. I will try to keep it brief due to a character limit and how I like to rage about things. The first point I would like to make is regarding the family dynamic. I believe strongly that members of the British Royal Family aren't particularly cuddly. I believe that his mother was very affectionate, and once she died, everything was very stiff and formal. As a history major who studied European history, I can say that I have read in my studies that this is a pretty common practice for European royals. Couple that with the fact that you know your father cheated on your mother with someone who is hideous inside and out, AND that you were birthed as a plan b and spare parts for your heir sibling...I can see why he has issues with his family members. Not only that, spare children have historically been able to live more adventurous lives. I can see where that would be a bone of contention for William, who must live a pretty formal, stuffy life. It seems as though several members of this family are worried more about public opinion than creating and maintaining relationships of substance with each other, and that is sad.The second point I would like to touch on is Harry's military service. He has never said that he is not from a life of privilege, nor that he has not benefited from that. He still went through the same training as everyone else when he joined the military. Yes, people helped him because of who he was, but he worked hard. He loved being in the military. He did things that any servicemember would have to do. He enjoyed working with veterans, and still does. He has done a lot for them. It annoys me that people try to downplay his experiences and charity work. My third take away from this book is about his relationships. He has been with other girls before his current wife. Those girls were relentlessly hounded by the press. He was born into a life in the public eye, and any girl he chose to be with would have to understand that they would be lumped in by comparison. Following these girls around and showing up to their families homes is really disgusting behavior. I cannot imagine what it must be like to date or marry someone that is famous in any capacity. I feel that his wife gets a lot of unfair treatment. I have to admit I do not know a lot about her, but I do not think she deserves the constant vilification that she has gotten in the media. People blame her for Harry leaving the UK. It seems as though he is a grown adult and can make his own choices. He did not ask to be born, for the life he was given, for his trauma from the media and his family, and certainly not to have nonsense spread about him and his wife. His wife was very clearly in a dark place, and having been through this similar situation multiple times, he chose what was best for him and his family. He never said he would stop being a public figure or doing charity work...he just asked for the harassment to stop and for his family to accept and love him. Why are people so vapid about this?My fourth, and last point, is going to be about the paparazzi. In the US, we all know how they harass celebrities. In fact, many celebs have advocated against these people photographing and harassing their children. Imagine the lies we have all read at the grocery store. TMZ is a particularly vile paparazzi machine. They pick the bones of everyone, releasing autopsy reports, filming people in clear distress (ie Britney Spears), harassing people on the street at all hours, following them in cars. Imagine how many articles you click to feed that interest in entertainment and celebrity. Celebs choose to be public figures, but they do still have the right to only share what they want. We do not have the right to every detail of anyone's life, only what they choose to share. Why would it be any different in Europe? People love to know about famous people, and gossip about their romantic relationships, pregnancies, and if they are doing drugs. It is very obvious that the media had a big role in his mother's death, or at least the obvious misery in her life. All of this was public fodder, and a little kid was in the spotlight. People feel entitled to him. I also believe that the media will say anything for a story, especially if motivated by people with ulterior motives, and I think that has certainly been the case for him. Wanting a more private life where everything is not blasted all over the place does not mean he is now seeking attention. He can do appearances, shows, and whatever else that he chooses to do that is scheduled press. He is simply asking for people to stop following him all over the place (and his wife and kids) and let them live their lives without gossip about who is feuding and what they ate at a cafe. None of this makes him a whiney, awful person like so many people want to say. It's these keyboard warriors and TikTok people that feel like they are entitled to tell someone how to live their life and that their experiences mean nothing and they should shut up and endure something they hate or that hurts them. It really reminds me of animals at Sea World. Be miserable, but perform for me because I said so. If you are one of these types, please take a genuine look at yourself.I do not believe that Harry is whining, or begging for attention. He is sharing his personal feelings and experiences. Some of those have been thrown all over for inaccuracy, but we all know that witness statements aren't always accurate. Just because some details are incorrect, does not mean that his personal experiences, life, and feelings are invalid. I rarely rate anything five stars, but I am rating this. I enjoyed the book, and I applaud the courage it has taken to be accountable for actions in the past, and honest and introspective. He is very candid about his poor behavior, such as wearing the Nazi costume and his racial slurs. People drag him for that, but think about how many words and phrases we say (especially in the South) that have a direct line to slavery and the treatment of Natives. We do not know we are ignorant until we learn we are ignorant. He has apologized, learned, and is not hiding his stupidity. He is very open and honest about how his mother's death, his family emotional emptiness, petty arguments, and their unwillingness to understand and have honest conversations has affected him. He has been very honest about how the constant barrage of cameras every time he walks down the street affected him and his friends. I think he is probably the most honest and emotionally stable member of his entire family. The book was well written, and an exceptional read.Show more",5,Wow I have a lot of thoughts about this book I will try to keep it brief due to a character limit and how I like to rage about things

Other than feeling deeply personal and sad, nothing else was really shocking to me nor did I feel he took to task Empire or colonialism quite enough, but I hope he continues this journey to peace and family.This is a very long memoir, and I had to absorb it in pieces and while doing other things because the grief is really really palpable.

Rating 4 out of 5,"SpareBy Prince HarryThis book gives a good insight into what life is like for Harry. How the sleezy press, not real news agencies, have an unhealthy relationship with the royal family and the family allows it. (I saw a show on this also so it's not just Harry's view.) I guess if the press isn't after you and after a different family member then feel lucky in the eyes of the royals!I thought it must have been hard to express all he did. It's easy for people to criticize him but they aren't walking in his shoes. I myself, thought he was easy on his father but it's his only parent left and I am sure he loves him regardless of his mistakes. I have to say I enjoyed this book. Harry seemed to be talking to me. I got the audio version from the library. His voice was soothing and yet full of honesty and displayed just the right amount of emotion to be proper! Very British! I was elated with his highs in life and tearful with his lows. I cried when Megan cried. They were both trapped.

Rating 4 out of 5,"Honestly, I don't feel right rating such a personal book. but alas, I feel like I have to. This book is honest, raw, and real. everything that the institution never let Harry or anyone in that family be. This book is controversial when honestly? it shouldn't be. Prince Harry wrote this book to claim and say his truth, something that he never was permitted to. It's sad, it's heartbreaking. Despite the insane amount of privilege he had, to read about a little boy who can't even acknowledge his mother's death and convinced himself that she ran away to be free so he doesn't have to feel the pain and grief was absolutely devastating. There's a lot of negative comments hurled at both Harry and his wife and ultimately this book. A lot of anger and hate because apparently speaking your truth means talking shit about your family. Well, just because they're family and they're related to you by blood does not mean talking about what they did is wrong. He never talked shit about them in this book, he simply said what happened and what they did and said. And if people perceive this truth from Harry's persepctive as ""talking shit"" that instead says a lot about his family members, not him. A lot of people thought that this book would be entertainment like yay an exposé and I will admit it, so did I. But it's not that at all.

Rating 4 out of 5,"I went into Prince Harry’s memoir with a lot of skepticism, but I ended up really enjoying it and being filled with compassion for Harry. I understand people’s skepticism and valid criticism of it. I see it, too. Harry is exceptionally privileged and to maintain the lifestyle he’s accustomed to he continues to stay in the public eye despite saying he wants privacy. And I also realize that this is one side of a story with many characters who may have other (even opposing) things to say. But I also know that, like with all memoirs, to expose your own vulnerabilities means exposing the people you love as well. I’m sure his family is hurt by Harry. But they have also hurt Harry. Mostly by their silence and complicity with the press (despite the illusion of staying silent—they do speak their minds through royal sources). Though it became clear to me that this was less family expose and more an expose of the dangerous paparazzi (particularly English paparazzi) and the press and its toxic relationship with the royal family. Harry’s trauma was bookended by the death of his mother at the beginning of the book and the hounding of his wife at the end of the book. And ultimately, although it’s very clear that the royal family is very dysfunctional (but honestly, is anyone surprised?), it’s also clear that Harry loves his brother, and father, and granny deeply. I really hope that at some point they are, all of them, able to take the logs out of their own eyes and humbly reconcile. I listened to this one on audiobook and that is really the best way to go. Even the most salacious bits are softened when you hear them in Harry’s own voice. Or so that was my experience.

Rating 5 out of 5,"At 400 plus pages, SPARE by Prince Harry, the fastest-selling non-fiction book of all time, as declared by the Guiness World Record, deserves all the hype and rave demands. It is engrossing as it is compelling. I laughed out loud in places, angered at other times, and cried at some surreal moments. I am not a fan of the Royal Family or I do not seek information about them. I have hyperawereness of them, of course, because of their fame rooted in history but it never occured to me to read books about them. But I cannot deny that I am intrigued of how really the monarchy works from the inside. This book is just the perfect place to start, told by the Prince himself.Reading SPARE, I thought how miserable a life of a Prince can be. There is simply no words to describe how sickening it is to be constantly photographed, barraged, harrased, monitored, and stalked. I thought before it is fairy-tale-happily-ever-after life but it is burdensome and prison-like on a different and unimaginable level. Prince Harry experienced it all, took it all, fought with all his might. It is simply not easy to be a Prince. With Royalty comes a high price. But this book is about his determination to fight the system of lies, inaction, racism, vilification even at the cost of his being royal. It is raw, honest, open, revealing, painful, and thoughtful. Not to be missed in this lifetime!Show more",5,At 400 plus pages SPARE by Prince Harry the fastestselling nonfiction book of all time as declared by the Guiness World Record deserves all the hype and rave demands It is engrossing as it is compelling I laughed out loud in places angered at other times and cried at some surreal moments I am not a fan of the Royal Family or I do not seek information about them I have hyperawereness of them of course because of their fame rooted in history but it never occured to me to read books about them But I cannot deny that I am intrigued of how really the monarchy works from the inside This book is just the perfect place to start told by the Prince himselfReading SPARE I thought how miserable a life of a Prince can be There is simply no words to describe how sickening it is to be constantly photographed barraged harrased monitored and stalked I thought before it is fairytalehappilyeverafter life but it is burdensome and prisonlike on a different and unimaginable level Prince Harry experienced it all took it all fought with all his might It is simply not easy to be a Prince With Royalty comes a high price But this book is about his determination to fight the system of lies inaction racism vilification even at the cost of his being royal It is raw honest open revealing painful and thoughtful Not to be missed in this lifetimeShow more

Rating 5 out of 5,"I admit: I'm fascinated by the British Royal Family. I don't read tabloids or pick up even more the reputable magazines with them on the cover, but if there's a news article . . . I click. Because, I mean . . . come on. It's real life drama! It's real life soap opera stuff! And you're never quite sure what's real and what isn't. ""Sources inside the palace say . . ."" ""A friend close to the Prince reports . . ."" Uh huh. Sure. And the tell all books by former butlers and Kitty Kelley . . . Heady stuff, I must admit. So, this book was fascinating: the first one written by a member of the family. And I've always had a soft spot for Harry. He always seemed like the fun one, that cheeky fellow redhead! He's the one who looks like he's genuinely smiling at gatherings, who seems genuinely moved at events, and not either bored or putting up a front. I will admit that I always assumed if someone was going to really crack, really tell the Firm where to get off, and write an expose, my money would have been on Andrew and Fergie's daughters. But when Harry married an American, I was like, Oh, I bet the culture shock is gonna be WILD. And it has been. And it truly was sad and fascinating all at once to see what it has been like for someone to grow up, not only in the public eye to an ABSURD extent, but to also grow up in this family of completely emotionally stunted people, and yet spend so much time as an adult with ""normal"" people like soldiers, and with truly good people, doing charity work. At some point, any person with any curiosity about life at all was bound to see that their life was not. normal. at. all. And not in a good way, but in a way that could only lead you either toward a complete breakdown or becoming a total asshole, just as a survival instinct. William has gone the total asshole route (oh, what a surprise to anyone who has ever seen him talk or pretend to interact with people). Harry, I have no doubt, would have ended up dead if he hadn't first decided to take care of himself, and then met someone who was like, I love you, but you need help. Do I believe this book is the truth? Yes. I'm sure there are things he doesn't remember right, and we can't know what other people were thinking or why they did the things they did (which he mentions). But everything he's talking about certainly adds up. I was telling my sister, ""I remember seeing headlines about him going to rehab, being badly injured . . . but at the same time, there are pictures of him on diplomatic tours. So, how could he have been in and out of rehab, and the hospital? If he's such a druggie and a screw up, how did he graduate from a prestigious school, and serve with honor in the military?"" And the hateful, hurtful comments about Meghan and their marriage are obvious. I've seen the side-by-side comparisons from the same papers, praising Kate for the things they condemn Meghan for. They always need to have a villain: It was Camilla for years. There's also usually some saucy, naughty tidbits: Fergie's affair, Harry the Drug Addict, there were even some digs at Kate back in the day. It's clear that Harry and now Meghan is taking the heat off the rest of the family, and they're too relieved to help them. I'm glad they're out of there, frankly.

Rating 3 out of 5,"This is a REALLY long memoir. During some of it I listened to it on 1.3 speed on audible, otherwise, I don't know if I'd have gotten through it.I'm going to get this out of the way: I don't think Spare is as bad as some people are making it out to be. I also don't think it's as good as some others think it is. Spare is obviously ghost written. I have a problem with ghost writing. I wish the ghost writers name was on the cover with Prince Harry. It feels disingenuous to me.Spare is a memoir of Prince Harry's life, from childhood to the very recent past, split into three parts (plus an epilogue). Each part felt different, and also too long. Thats my biggest grievance with the Spare –– It needs editing. The main point of this memoir seems to be his status as the spare – it's the leading conversation, the title, and an ending remark by meghan to harry. This mental battle of his really is the most interesting part of the book and I enjoyed exploring it, but at the same time (for me) his military service takes up a huge chunk of the story. I could have done with less of it. Harry also avoids any mention of his or his wifes on mistakes, he glazes over his own issues as youthful mistakes (i'm sorry, but everyone should know dressing up as a nazi for halloween is awful). No one is perfect.All in all, I think if this had been split into two memoirs, or maybe just cleaned up and spared a hundred pages or so, it would have been a better read.The star of the memoir is his love story with Meghan, and that doesn't even start until the very end. I would have loved a larger focus on his found family with Meghan, and less on his rivalry with his brother. The goal of this memoir seems to be to share his story and humanize the both of them, (and yes make money for their very expensive security....) and yet that humanizing is kind of put on the back burner in order to focus on the sibling rivalry.There are four types of readers that will enjoy Spare for different reasons:1) Those that love Princess Diana, and want to read about that aspect of Harrys life -– the loss of his mother, his denial, the aftermath, the eerie parallel that his wife Meghan seems to be experiencing with the media.2) Those that are really interested in Prince Harry's military experience.3) Those that are just here for the gossip.4) Those that want to hate read this because they hate the royal family, or at least hate Harry and Meghan. These readers are the strangest to me. Why spend time reading something you hate? This book is soo long? How do hate readers do it? I always am amazed by one star reviews of long books like this. Despite all of the structural issues, the problem of ghost writing, the question of validity regarding some of the anecdotes, ––my issue is that all these events are just from Harry's POV, so it's hard to know really what someone else was feeling, or intended. it's all he said...he said–– I did think there were some valuable conversations around grief, loss, privacy!!!, fame, and journalistic integrity. Paparazzi are literally legal stalkers. It's disgusting. On a lighter note, I know this is controversial, but the section about his frost bitten ""todger"" was hilarious.All in all, I'm glad I read it, I did take some value from it, I do think it humanizes members of the royal family, and honestly, I don't think it's quite as vicious as some people feel it is. The royal family is essentially a family, and family don't always get along. Spare is a unique glimpse into an otherwise closed world.Show more",3,This is a REALLY long memoir During some of it I listened to it on 13 speed on audible otherwise I dont know if Id have gotten through itIm going to get this out of the way I dont think Spare is as bad as some people are making it out to be I also dont think its as good as some others think it is Spare is obviously ghost written I have a problem with ghost writing I wish the ghost writers name was on the cover with Prince Harry It feels disingenuous to meSpare is a memoir of Prince Harrys life from childhood to the very recent past split into three parts plus an epilogue Each part felt different and also too long Thats my biggest grievance with the Spare  It needs editing The main point of this memoir seems to be his status as the spare  its the leading conversation the title and an ending remark by meghan to harry This mental battle of his really is the most interesting part of the book and I enjoyed exploring it but at the same time for me his military service takes up a huge chunk of the story I could have done with less of it Harry also avoids any mention of his or his wifes on mistakes he glazes over his own issues as youthful mistakes im sorry but everyone should know dressing up as a nazi for halloween is awful No one is perfectAll in all I think if this had been split into two memoirs or maybe just cleaned up and spared a hundred pages or so it would have been a better readThe star of the memoir is his love story with Meghan and that doesnt even start until the very end I would have loved a larger focus on his found family with Meghan and less on his rivalry with his brother The goal of this memoir seems to be to share his story and humanize the both of them and yes make money for their very expensive security and yet that humanizing is kind of put on the back burner in order to focus on the sibling rivalryThere are four types of readers that will enjoy Spare for different reasons1 Those that love Princess Diana and want to read about that aspect of Harrys life  the loss of his mother his denial the aftermath the eerie parallel that his wife Meghan seems to be experiencing with the media2 Those that are really interested in Prince Harrys military experience3 Those that are just here for the gossip4 Those that want to hate read this because they hate the royal family or at least hate Harry and Meghan These readers are the strangest to me Why spend time reading something you hate This book is soo long How do hate readers do it I always am amazed by one star reviews of long books like this Despite all of the structural issues the problem of ghost writing the question of validity regarding some of the anecdotes my issue is that all these events are just from Harrys POV so its hard to know really what someone else was feeling or intended its all he saidhe said I did think there were some valuable conversations around grief loss privacy fame and journalistic integrity Paparazzi are literally legal stalkers Its disgusting On a lighter note I know this is controversial but the section about his frost bitten todger was hilariousAll in all Im glad I read it I did take some value from it I do think it humanizes members of the royal family and honestly I dont think its quite as vicious as some people feel it is The royal family is essentially a family and family dont always get along Spare is a unique glimpse into an otherwise closed worldShow more
Rating 3 out of 5,"I’ve never had any sort of fascination with the royal family, but I am a nosy person who loves a memoir with people exposing behind the scenes secrets. So I was interested to pick up Prince Harry’s book to get a peek into the life of someone growing up royal and dealing with the drama with his family. This definitely does provide a lot of fascinating and heartbreaking stories about what his childhood was like. Hearing his perspective of his mother’s death and the ways he coped (or didn’t really cope with it) was very sad. If there’s one main focus of this book it’s Harry’s hatred of the tabloid press and paparazzi and how they have intruded on his life, twisted reality, and spread lies about him and Meghan. He definitely goes the hardest with pointing out the flaws and reprehensible behavior of the press. I was hoping that he’d have the same energy for when he was writing about his family. While he does definitely reveal shady and awful things they’ve said and done, it still felt like he was holding back. Also, the book is just way too long. Some portions feel like it’s a lot of extraneous information that wasn’t really adding to the book as a whole. The way he also spoke about doing work in Africa being “his thing” instead of William’s was weird. He does include a friend being like “uh, you can both do good stuff there,” but I feel like the book would’ve been better if there was more reflection on that. But maybe he’s not at that point yet, I don’t know.

Rating 4 out of 5,"Spare may be Prince Harry's story, but the thing I find the most interesting is the fact that he actually used a ghostwriter. I'm not sure what the reasoning was for this but whatever it was, I have a feeling he perfectly captured what Prince Harry wanted to get across. There is a lot of controversy surrounding this book, and I don’t even follow the Royal Family, but once I saw how big it was getting, I had to pick it up and see what all the fuss was about. This is a large book at just over 400 pages, and that put the audiobook at over 15.5 hours, but since Prince Harry narrated it that just further cemented listening to it for me. I don’t think it would have been as good as it was without his voice, and I am so happy he decided to do his own narration. The parts about Princess Diana’s death were so hard to listen to, and there are a lot of things that made me feel for him. Unlike some readers, this didn’t come off as a pity party to me, and I really do think he just wanted to be completely honest and tell the world how he feels. I have no idea why it is so strange to me that Prince Harry lives in the states now, but I can definitely understand his need to get away from that family. Some of the things he shared in this book are making me view certain people in a new light, and it kind of blew my mind how awful Kate and William were to him and Meghan. And speaking of Meghan, I adored hearing the story of how they met, and it actually made me want to watch Harry & Meghan on Netflix even more. I am dying to hear her side of things, and even though I’m sure some of the information will be a repeat of what I read here, it will be nice to have her input as well. I kept forgetting that Spare is Prince Harry’s memoir and I think that was probably because I didn’t understand the meaning of the title. Well, I sure do now, and I don’t care what anyone says, no one should have to feel that way about themselves. All in all, this was an eye-opening read for me and if you follow the Royals or are even slightly interested in hearing Harry’s story, I would definitely recommend this.Show more",4,Spare may be Prince Harrys story but the thing I find the most interesting is the fact that he actually used a ghostwriter Im not sure what the reasoning was for this but whatever it was I have a feeling he perfectly captured what Prince Harry wanted to get across There is a lot of controversy surrounding this book and I dont even follow the Royal Family but once I saw how big it was getting I had to pick it up and see what all the fuss was about This is a large book at just over 400 pages and that put the audiobook at over 155 hours but since Prince Harry narrated it that just further cemented listening to it for me I dont think it would have been as good as it was without his voice and I am so happy he decided to do his own narration The parts about Princess Dianas death were so hard to listen to and there are a lot of things that made me feel for him Unlike some readers this didnt come off as a pity party to me and I really do think he just wanted to be completely honest and tell the world how he feels I have no idea why it is so strange to me that Prince Harry lives in the states now but I can definitely understand his need to get away from that family Some of the things he shared in this book are making me view certain people in a new light and it kind of blew my mind how awful Kate and William were to him and Meghan And speaking of Meghan I adored hearing the story of how they met and it actually made me want to watch Harry  Meghan on Netflix even more I am dying to hear her side of things and even though Im sure some of the information will be a repeat of what I read here it will be nice to have her input as well I kept forgetting that Spare is Prince Harrys memoir and I think that was probably because I didnt understand the meaning of the title Well I sure do now and I dont care what anyone says no one should have to feel that way about themselves All in all this was an eyeopening read for me and if you follow the Royals or are even slightly interested in hearing Harrys story I would definitely recommend thisShow more

Rating 2 out of 5,"This book was ALL over the place. But for the sake of clarity, I will organize my review into three main categories: (1) Harry before Meghan; (2) Harry after Meghan; and (3) cringe quotes. 1. Harry before MeghanHarry spends approximately the first 60% of the book going on and on about how difficult his life is. While I recognize my lack of sympathy for rich people, and ESPECIALLY royal people -- aka those who are rich purely because of circumstance and human suffering -- Harry makes it really difficult for me to acknowledge even the fair points that he makes. I can't imagine losing a parent, or being hounded by the paps, or being smeared in the press, yet somehow, Harry makes me not care. To restate, he is so whiny and annoying about it that I literally could not care less. And don't get me started on the amount of times he brings up his ""Mummy"" at the worst possible moment (more on that in part 3). 2. Harry after Meghan This review is in no way an indictment of Meghan. Do I find her kinda annoying? Yes. Do I think it's strange that Harry and Meghan (rightfully) bemoan the horrific treatment they've received at the hands of the press, but then repeatedly and relentlessly subject themselves to the press via podcasts, interviews, Netflix shows, etc.? Yes. But it's their life. If their most serious crime is being irritating, that's fine. I can think of way worse (Prince Andrew, anyone?). Also, Meghan ABSOLUTELY was the victim of extreme racism in the press and within the royal family. Of that I have no doubt. But two things (annoying couple, racist press) can be true at the same time. When Meghan comes into Harry's life, he is very sweet about her, and it's clear that he really loves her. But for someone who is so obsessed with how miserable his own life is, and how miserable the press made his mother, he is remarkably inept when it comes to recognizing strife in the life of his own wife. But, as Spare made clear, he is so conditioned to seeing himself as the hero -- nay, underdog! -- in his own story, he still makes himself out to be Meghan's unwavering protector. I have more to say, but to sum it up, Harry is a privileged fool. 3. Cringe QuotesWhile reading some of these, you may be stuck between the hope that it's a joke vs. the deeply rooted knowledge that he's being entirely serious. But still, I leave the discretion to decide Harry's intent to you. ""'The past is never dead. It's not even past.' When I discovered that quotation not long ago on BrainyQuote.com..."" ""I felt an inexplicable bond with Stewie, prophet without honor."" Yeah he is actually talking about Family Guy, in case you were wondering. ""But I wasn't afraid. Instead...I was empathetic. And the young males [cows] seemed to know."" Maybe I'm being influenced too much by personal experience (my sister) but people who proclaim themselves animal whisperers bug me so bad. ""She could tell how at home I felt with them. She said: 'I think your body was born in Britain, but your soul was born here in Africa.'"" In his defense, it was someone else who allegedly said this about him, but this goes to the theme of him seeing Africa as some sort of playing ground for him. Botswana is his escape, but when referencing charity work the acknowledgment of individual nations always gives way to a blanket ""Africa."" Nit-picky of me to say, but noticeable and bothersome nonetheless. ""They [the army bootcamp people] can't break me, I thought. Is it, I wondered, because I'm already broken?"" I KNOW that I'm being horribly callous but he is so dramatic and Diana wouldn't want this. ""I went up and down the rows, sifting through the racks, seeing nothing I liked. With time running out I narrowed my options to two. A British pilot's uniform. And a sand-colored Nazi uniform. With a swastika armband. And a flat cap. I phoned Willy and Kate, asked what they thought. Nazi uniform, they said."" This is just so baffling. Like yeah William and Kate are arguably just as culpable, but he managed to make one of his biggest f-ups in life a ""but Mummy!! He told me to!!"" and I just thought it was weird. ""But also: war, death, whatever, anything was better than remaining in Britain, which was its own kind of battle."" Ah yes, the slaughter of Afghani civilians is preferable to the meanies at the newspaper. ""He [Harry's helicopter trainer or something] was a Navy civvie, a kindly grandpa who loved sailing -- a top bloke. But he had the heart of a fucking ninja. And at that moment I needed a ninja."" No words. ""Between these thoughts of Mummy and death and my frost nipped penis, I was in danger of becoming as anxious as the groom."" The first time (there are more) that his penis and his mummy are in the same sentence. ""My penis was oscillating between extremely sensitive and borderline traumatized. I'd been trying some home remedies, include one recommended by a friend. She'd urged me to apply Elizabeth Arden cream. My mum used that on her lips. You want me to put that on my todger? It works, Harry. Trust me. I found a tube, and the minute I opened it the smell transported my through time. I felt as if my mother was right there in the room."" Freud! Come get your man! ""The likeliest cure, he [the derm Harry went to for his 'todger'] announced at last, would be time. What do you mean? Time? Time, he said, heals. Really, Doc? That hasn't been my experience.” ANOTHER mummy/penis interlude. ""It never dawned on me that I was a wounded soldier. And my war didn't begin in Afghanistan. It began in August 1997."" Again, maybe I'm callous, but when he says stuff like this I roll my eyes. ""One very close mate hired a seamstress to make me a bespoke cock cushion. Square, supportive, it was sewn from pieces of the softest fleece and... Enough said."" No Harry, tell us more. ""But selfishly, I also didn't want the press coming for me. To be called lazy? I shuddered. I never wanted to see that word attached to my name. The press had called me stupid for most of my life, and naughty, and RACIST [caps are my own], but they dared to call me lazy...I couldn't guarantee that I wouldn't go down Fleet Street and start pulling people out from behind their desks."" Do we even need my commentary on this one?""I knelt beside the female [lion], touched her skin, looked at her half-closed amber eyes.

""I'd made the mistake of googling and watching some of her love scenes online. I'd witnessed her and a castmate mauling each other in some sort of office or conference room...It would take electric shock therapy to get those images out of my head."" Why would he google that? Also keep in mind that at this point he had already had sex with her in real life. Weird to google no matter what time, but it makes me think he was trying to get off to the video but then got disturbed. Creep behavior no matter the reason.And to sum up the EXTREMELY weird mother thing that he has, Harry ends the book with him delivering his daughter into the world: ""I slid my hands under the tiny back and neck. Gently, but firmly, as I'd seen in films, I pulled our precious daughter from that world into this, and cradled her just a moment, trying to smile at her, to see her, but honestly, I couldn't see anything. I wanted to say: Hello. I wanted to say: Where have you come from? I wanted to say: Is it better there? Is it peaceful? Are you frightened?"" Maybe it's the English major in me and I'm going too deep, but a call for the womb from a man with extreme Mummy issues is...definitely something.Show more",2,This book was ALL over the place But for the sake of clarity I will organize my review into three main categories 1 Harry before Meghan 2 Harry after Meghan and 3 cringe quotes 1 Harry before MeghanHarry spends approximately the first 60 of the book going on and on about how difficult his life is While I recognize my lack of sympathy for rich people and ESPECIALLY royal people  aka those who are rich purely because of circumstance and human suffering  Harry makes it really difficult for me to acknowledge even the fair points that he makes I cant imagine losing a parent or being hounded by the paps or being smeared in the press yet somehow Harry makes me not care To restate he is so whiny and annoying about it that I literally could not care less And dont get me started on the amount of times he brings up his Mummy at the worst possible moment more on that in part 3 2 Harry after Meghan This review is in no way an indictment of Meghan Do I find her kinda annoying Yes Do I think its strange that Harry and Meghan rightfully bemoan the horrific treatment theyve received at the hands of the press but then repeatedly and relentlessly subject themselves to the press via podcasts interviews Netflix shows etc Yes But its their life If their most serious crime is being irritating thats fine I can think of way worse Prince Andrew anyone Also Meghan ABSOLUTELY was the victim of extreme racism in the press and within the royal family Of that I have no doubt But two things annoying couple racist press can be true at the same time When Meghan comes into Harrys life he is very sweet about her and its clear that he really loves her But for someone who is so obsessed with how miserable his own life is and how miserable the press made his mother he is remarkably inept when it comes to recognizing strife in the life of his own wife But as Spare made clear he is so conditioned to seeing himself as the hero  nay underdog  in his own story he still makes himself out to be Meghans unwavering protector I have more to say but to sum it up Harry is a privileged fool 3 Cringe QuotesWhile reading some of these you may be stuck between the hope that its a joke vs the deeply rooted knowledge that hes being entirely serious But still I leave the discretion to decide Harrys intent to you The past is never dead Its not even past When I discovered that quotation not long ago on BrainyQuotecom I felt an inexplicable bond with Stewie prophet without honor Yeah he is actually talking about Family Guy in case you were wondering But I wasnt afraid InsteadI was empathetic And the young males cows seemed to know Maybe Im being influenced too much by personal experience my sister but people who proclaim themselves animal whisperers bug me so bad She could tell how at home I felt with them She said I think your body was born in Britain but your soul was born here in Africa In his defense it was someone else who allegedly said this about him but this goes to the theme of him seeing Africa as some sort of playing ground for him Botswana is his escape but when referencing charity work the acknowledgment of individual nations always gives way to a blanket Africa Nitpicky of me to say but noticeable and bothersome nonetheless They the army bootcamp people cant break me I thought Is it I wondered because Im already broken I KNOW that Im being horribly callous but he is so dramatic and Diana wouldnt want this I went up and down the rows sifting through the racks seeing nothing I liked With time running out I narrowed my options to two A British pilots uniform And a sandcolored Nazi uniform With a swastika armband And a flat cap I phoned Willy and Kate asked what they thought Nazi uniform they said This is just so baffling Like yeah William and Kate are arguably just as culpable but he managed to make one of his biggest fups in life a but Mummy He told me to and I just thought it was weird But also war death whatever anything was better than remaining in Britain which was its own kind of battle Ah yes the slaughter of Afghani civilians is preferable to the meanies at the newspaper He Harrys helicopter trainer or something was a Navy civvie a kindly grandpa who loved sailing  a top bloke But he had the heart of a fucking ninja And at that moment I needed a ninja No words Between these thoughts of Mummy and death and my frost nipped penis I was in danger of becoming as anxious as the groom The first time there are more that his penis and his mummy are in the same sentence My penis was oscillating between extremely sensitive and borderline traumatized Id been trying some home remedies include one recommended by a friend Shed urged me to apply Elizabeth Arden cream My mum used that on her lips You want me to put that on my todger It works Harry Trust me I found a tube and the minute I opened it the smell transported my through time I felt as if my mother was right there in the room Freud Come get your man The likeliest cure he the derm Harry went to for his todger announced at last would be time What do you mean Time Time he said heals Really Doc That hasnt been my experience ANOTHER mummypenis interlude It never dawned on me that I was a wounded soldier And my war didnt

Rating 4 out of 5,"I didn't expect to like Spare. I expected to find Harry and Meghan to be whiners, but after reading what they endured at the hands of the media, I don't blame them one bit. It's no secret that Harry holds the media responsible for the death of his mother Diana, as well he should. Perhaps this attitude causes the media to strike out at him in retribution. There is nothing that they can say in their own defense about that terrible night in August 1997, so they take their guilt out on him in other ways. The ludicrous, nasty filthy things that have been said about Meghan in the British press is beyond contempt. In the 21st century, it's abhorrent that this kind of racism is considered printable, and I applaud Harry for taking a stand and moving his family away from such poison. I cringe that my original opinion was formed by the media; perhaps your opinion will alter as well if you read this book.Harry's honesty about his mental health challenges, his willingness to rethink his life, to stand up to a powerful force (the 'Family firm') and to do his own thinking about what kind of life he wants is admirable. I always wanted to like Meghan because she is a strong feminist, but I sat on the fence for years. I admired the way she wrote to a corporation to complain when she was just a kid. I liked a lot of the things that she said. And now that I have heard Harry's story, I am able to like her. It doesn't mean that I like everything that they do, but more realistically, I see them as human beings, with vulnerabilities, and flaws. Good on you Harry!Show more",4,I didnt expect to like Spare I expected to find Harry and Meghan to be whiners but after reading what they endured at the hands of the media I dont blame them one bit Its no secret that Harry holds the media responsible for the death of his mother Diana as well he should Perhaps this attitude causes the media to strike out at him in retribution There is nothing that they can say in their own defense about that terrible night in August 1997 so they take their guilt out on him in other ways The ludicrous nasty filthy things that have been said about Meghan in the British press is beyond contempt In the 21st century its abhorrent that this kind of racism is considered printable and I applaud Harry for taking a stand and moving his family away from such poison I cringe that my original opinion was formed by the media perhaps your opinion will alter as well if you read this bookHarrys honesty about his mental health challenges his willingness to rethink his life to stand up to a powerful force the Family firm and to do his own thinking about what kind of life he wants is admirable I always wanted to like Meghan because she is a strong feminist but I sat on the fence for years I admired the way she wrote to a corporation to complain when she was just a kid I liked a lot of the things that she said And now that I have heard Harrys story I am able to like her It doesnt mean that I like everything that they do but more realistically I see them as human beings with vulnerabilities and flaws Good on you HarryShow more

Rating 5 out of 5,"This book is so much more than the ‘tell all’ that it is being reported as. I feel like the true beauty in it is the tale of a young man who tragically lost his mother, and his grief and healing and eventual growth from this loss that he was able to recognize the patterns of what was happening in his experiences and stop the pattern. Do you get all the tea about the royal family too? Yes, but I feel like that’s secondary to the heart of the memoir. In my humble opinion at least. I really enjoyed it, and am truly astounded by everything he has gone through in his life. I find it truly remarkable that he was able to break the cycles of generational trauma and pick a different path for his family.Show more",5,This book is so much more than the tell all that it is being reported as I feel like the true beauty in it is the tale of a young man who tragically lost his mother and his grief and healing and eventual growth from this loss that he was able to recognize the patterns of what was happening in his experiences and stop the pattern Do you get all the tea about the royal family too Yes but I feel like thats secondary to the heart of the memoir In my humble opinion at least I really enjoyed it and am truly astounded by everything he has gone through in his life I find it truly remarkable that he was able to break the cycles of generational trauma and pick a different path for his familyShow more
Rating 1 out of 5,"Highly disturbed and self-victimised individual with mom and dad issues, who blames everyone around him for his hurt feelings. This book has some pretty intimate moments that should under no circumstances be talked about to a public. Instead of protecting his family in public eye, this poor excuse of a man is airing his family’s dirty laundry. I feel truly disappointed and disgusted with both this book and Harry. Particularly, when I think about the late Queen, his grandmother, who at 21y swore to dedicate her life to serving her people.

Rating 1 out of 5,"Omigod. Didn’t finish it, have no desire to finish it. No question Harry experienced traumatic events, but this self-serving whining is starting to get very old. I gave him the benefit of the doubt, but two years of self-victimization and desperate efforts to stay (or become) relevant have only become very tiresome. So he had trauma and issues growing up, he was part of a dysfunctional family - he doesn’t have the monopoly on that! Kudos to his wife for ensuring that most people know her name now, which, I suspect, was the point of all the drama. Unfortunately, she is no role model for anything, despite how she views herself.

Rating 3 out of 5,"Oh hello. I'm literally crawling out from my slump to review this book. I mean, how can I not?So, I went into this book with an already formed opinion about this couple. I wanted my opinion of them to change after finishing it. Rather than just hearing about someone else's opinion about the content, some that even might be taken out of context, let's see what he has to say myself now, shall we?Needless to say, some of my opinion still stands. But I guess I did feel a little sympathetic, not to the man he is now but to the boy he was. Some of the things he recounted, were unfortunate. And some, were just petty. There were a few things, I wished he didn't include in the book. The kill count, the virginity lost behind a pub, and especially his frostbite on his thingy... and especially not on the same sentence as his dead mother. (Something I've noted, he has a huge unresolved mummy issue.) Something are just too personal and I'm on the side of never air your family's dirty laundry. He mentioned how he detests leaks from the palace, sacrificing his and his wife reputation, and now, he's the like the biggest leak of all, sacrificing his family's rep... in a book that was supposed to condemn the media and paparazzi. I mean, in the end, when what you said and what you do seemed to contradict themselves, who's going to believe you?My feeling is summed up like this: I want to feel sorry for him, truly but there are choices that he made that I don't think were smart.And that's all.

Rating 3 out of 5,I personally cannot say this books was as insightful as it was claimed to be. But its one side of the story. It almost felt like a diary entry from a person who has not be able to speak for a very long time and specially things which in a normal situation could have him labelled as a mama's boy or something else for a matter of fact. This books definitely and for sure give an insight into how unprocessed grief looks like and what it can do to a person .This book does give an insight into what was told or claimed on TV. But I must say for sure it gives is an very clear picture of what the author personally feels or how they see the world around them. Specially how he saw things as a kid and what dirty laundry he wanted to tell people. It would be hard to say how much of this content is factual or personal perception on things that took place but it dose provide a insight into things. Things which he must have felt while growing up as a spare child or an replacement to a role. The name accurately projects what he must have felt growing up in such lime light. Taking this books as a actually tell would not be fare but ignoring it would do no justice to any information provided in the book. Lets just think of it as his side of the story and hope we get the other side to unfiltered to make a clear judgement on our part.Show more,3,I personally cannot say this books was as insightful as it was claimed to be But its one side of the story It almost felt like a diary entry from a person who has not be able to speak for a very long time and specially things which in a normal situation could have him labelled as a mamas boy or something else for a matter of fact This books definitely and for sure give an insight into how unprocessed grief looks like and what it can do to a person This book does give an insight into what was told or claimed on TV But I must say for sure it gives is an very clear picture of what the author personally feels or how they see the world around them Specially how he saw things as a kid and what dirty laundry he wanted to tell people It would be hard to say how much of this content is factual or personal perception on things that took place but it dose provide a insight into things Things which he must have felt while growing up as a spare child or an replacement to a role The name accurately projects what he must have felt growing up in such lime light Taking this books as a actually tell would not be fare but ignoring it would do no justice to any information provided in the book Lets just think of it as his side of the story and hope we get the other side to unfiltered to make a clear judgement on our partShow more
Rating 4 out of 5,"Thoroughly enjoyed listening to Harry narrate. At times I found him whiny and he definitely overshares a few cringey details but I didn't mind it. I'm nosey like that and I like personal details. The emotions surrounding his mom and his grief were heartfelt and devastating. Grief is such a powerful thing, especially when not dealt with. Harry's relationship with his family was sad. You can't help but feel the distance and coldness, even when there were times of joy.The latter part of his life to date, detailing his relationship with Meghan and everything they have gone through was moving. I appreciated hearing this from his take. The media and all they have been put through is just awful. If you enjoy celebrity memoirs and Royal gossip - don't miss this one.

Rating 3 out of 5,"2.75, I guess There's not much to say about this book that hasn't already been said. Other than the (I'm sorry to say it, Haz) very boring military section, it's a fast read and if you've followed the ""Megxit"" story at all, the last section will be very familiar to you. The writing is like, medium at best and doesn't actually sound like Harry, really - he's much more eloquent in interviews.Other than all the ""salacious"" details that have been making the rounds, the stand out takeaways for me are:1. Harry does not like Camilla and believes she has frequently promoted lies about Harry and other royal family members to protect herself and Charles, and to rehabilitate their image.2. Harry certainly loves Meghan but he did absolutely nothing to prepare her for the life of a royal, and he does not acknowledge this at all. Whoops, Haz.3. The way he talks about his relationship with Botswana bothers me. He calls it his real home and uses it as an escape many many times in his life...but like, does not ever acknowledge his direct lineage to, and in many ways still symbolically performing, colonialism in Africa?4. The level of fear and competition in the royal family seems so petty but is indeed the reality of these glorified indentured servants. In order to make life bearable in their gilded cage they must compete with their own family, their flesh and blood, to not be destroyed by the media, which of course makes their entire family dynamic completely fked up and unlike any other relationship with fame in the world.It must really suck to be royal.Show more",3,275 I guess Theres not much to say about this book that hasnt already been said Other than the Im sorry to say it Haz very boring military section its a fast read and if youve followed the Megxit story at all the last section will be very familiar to you The writing is like medium at best and doesnt actually sound like Harry really  hes much more eloquent in interviewsOther than all the salacious details that have been making the rounds the stand out takeaways for me are1 Harry does not like Camilla and believes she has frequently promoted lies about Harry and other royal family members to protect herself and Charles and to rehabilitate their image2 Harry certainly loves Meghan but he did absolutely nothing to prepare her for the life of a royal and he does not acknowledge this at all Whoops Haz3 The way he talks about his relationship with Botswana bothers me He calls it his real home and uses it as an escape many many times in his lifebut like does not ever acknowledge his direct lineage to and in many ways still symbolically performing colonialism in Africa4 The level of fear and competition in the royal family seems so petty but is indeed the reality of these glorified indentured servants In order to make life bearable in their gilded cage they must compete with their own family their flesh and blood to not be destroyed by the media which of course makes their entire family dynamic completely fked up and unlike any other relationship with fame in the worldIt must really suck to be royalShow more

Rating 1 out of 5,"I often feel weird about rating a non-fiction memoir because it's a retelling of a person's life; why would I rate it out of 5 stars? lol BUT I really didn't enjoy this one. Like everyone else, I was ready for the tea– the nitty gritty, the shocking revelations etc– but instead we got a subpar retelling of Prince(!!) Harry's very privileged life so far.  (Booooo give us the dirt inside the palace!) As for the controversial Taliban killings, I don't mind Harry talking about his military experience; however, I do take issue with the deliberate mention of the exact number of killings– I just think it's gross to reduce human beings to numbers/statistics on a page of a white man's memoir. It left too much of a sour feeling in my mouth that my entire reading experience was ruined after that chapter. In addition to this– the writing did not appeal to me. I will be honest and say that I did skim-read a few pages through because I just wasn't interested in certain parts of the book. To conclude, I can confidently say there are other memoirs more worthy of your time than this one.

Rating 5 out of 5,"Ok, the hate this man gets is absolutely asinine.I don't know how anyone could read this book and not be happy that he got out of that environment. Harry hates the media. And when I say media, I mean invasive media. Because, yes, this book is a form of media. But there's a huge difference in controlled media eg. documentaries and sit down interviews and books....and photographers trying to sneak onto your property or chase a woman into a tunnel to her death.I'm glad I decided to read this, even after all the 'leaks' came in. This was a long book. And oddly honest. He was very frank in his stories, but I see the purpose. If he lays out all his secrets, nothing can be hold against him. More than anything, I felt sad for him throughout a majority of this book. Also, I rarely do audiobooks. But I had to do it for this one. I wanted Harry's words read to me in his voice.

Rating 1 out of 5,"He’s thrown everyone he’s ever known under the bus. Far too long and lots of waxing poetic. Get ready for a detailed military reenactment and a bunch of stuff no one ever needed to know- cringe. For someone who “just wants privacy,” he messed that one up.

 further confirms that Spare is one of the fastest selling autobiographies since 2004 in America alone.Taking on the mighty cabal of the global media, and sharing a life within a mostly closed-up family—one of the most influential ones in the world, takes some guts. He did it. He made his point.I do believe that Prince Harry suffered his entire life under excessive, almost unnatural, media scrutiny, which caused the death of his mother. He loved her and only could dwell in her devotion for twelve years of his life. He struggles to get over her death. He misses her. His memories of her tore at my heart strings. Well, okay, it made me cry, actually. He shared numerous heartfelt memories of his family, particularly William and his father. He undoubtedly loves his father. He recalls, with affection, his dad's reaction to his participation in a Shakespeare play at school. So funny.
Opening night, my father sat dead center in a packed Farrer Theatre and no one had a better time. Here it was, his dream come true, a son performing Shakespeare, and he was getting his money’s worth. He roared, he howled, he applauded. But, inexplicably, at all the wrong moments. His timing was bizarrely off. He sat mute when everyone else was laughing. He laughed when everyone else was silent. More than noticeable, it was bloody distracting. The audience thought Pa was a plant, part of the performance. Who’s that over there, laughing at nothing? Oh—is that the Prince of Wales? Later, backstage, Pa was all compliments. You were wonderful, darling boy. But I couldn’t help looking cross. What’s the matter, darling boy? Pa, you laughed at all the wrong times!He was baffled. I was too. How could he have no idea what I was talking about?
I did not seek truth and facts in this book, since it is a primary source of memories and emotions. A personal interpretation. A personal truth. A young man coming to terms with a challenging life in the spotlight. We cannot imagine how it is like. But he does give us a glimpse into the cruel world of being public property. The truth behind the glamour and the glitz. The shadow side of the bright lights. When he finally gets access to the photos of his mother's death, his anger and sorrow are raw: I hadn’t known. I hadn’t dreamed. I’d been told that paps chased Mummy, that they’d hunted her like a pack of wild dogs, but I’d never dared to imagine that, like wild dogs, they’d also feasted on her defenseless body. I hadn’t been aware, before this moment, that the last thing Mummy saw on this earth was a flashbulb.I cried when I read it.Megan, who craved media attention and fame, got what she wished for, but on a scale she never envisioned. Not by a long shot. It is a kind of fame and fortune she could never comprehend until now. Hopefully she has learnt a lesson. I wish her well. I sincerely hope that Harry and Meghan will make it and be happy after all.Was this a 'truth bomb' for the Royals? A demolition ball hitting them where it hurts the most? Imagine one of your kids tells you that he feels like the organ-donor 'spare' for his sibling, 'the heir'? It will blow my mind. What a shocker for those who never thought about this child quite this way. And for Harry, to always be reminded that he was not born equal. That he was never to be treated or regarded as just as important as his brother. The other Royals took it in their stride. Accepted it. But Harry did not. He wants to be a man in his own right. He did it the only way he could. He wrote this book, despite the Royal maxim of never complain, never explain. After Princess Diana's untimely death, Harry, internationally, became the most popular Royal, after Queen Elizabeth. And although the media now tries everything in their power to crucify him for exposing their heinous abuse of their power, Harry still remains the no.1 sought-after Royal. I was astounded to read the insults spewed at him all over the media. Unbelievable. So openly hostile, like hyenas circling their pray, teeth exposed, tongues hanging out, salivating, death in their eyes. But he lashed out, and man, what a tour de force. The British media as well as the Royals, try now very hard to push Prince William and Kate onto the front pages. Both beautiful young people. Sadly, not Diana, nor Harry. Not even closely. And so by the way, neither will Megan ever be Princess Diana 2.0. Let's hope she will remain in the shadows of this war drama, and keep her children safe while their dad is fighting for their survival. Man alone.I first read Harry: The People's Prince by Christ Hutchins. So, Harry's own book was not as riveting as it should/could have been, I guess. However, the heartfelt tone and interpretation of his own life, as a primary source of information, did touch me deeply. I did not put on my biased glasses. Harry managed to wipe my own prejudices and mantras from my mind and took me into his world. Completely. Captain of his Soul he said. But also of mine. The shadow writer, J. R. Moehringer did a splendid job. Harry (about him and his brother William): How lost we are, I thought. How far we’ve strayed. How much damage has been done to our love, our bond, and why? All because a dreadful mob of dweebs and crones and cut-rate criminals and clinically diagnosable sadists along Fleet Street feel the need to get their jollies and plump their profits—and work out their personal issues—by tormenting one very large, very ancient, very dysfunctional family.Harry: My problem has never been with the monarchy, nor the concept of monarchy. It’s been with the press and the sick relationship that’s evolved between it and the Palace.If someone is of the opinion that it is 'woke-porn', so be it. Each to each own, right? Entitled, whining, privileged, brat, the anti-Harry & Megan-brigade demands you to say, since it is the instructions spewed out by the media, like a Teenage Oppositional Defiance Disorder for Adults. If they tell us to hate someone, then we better hate someone, or get cancelled. Cancel me.But in his acknowledgements, Harry says: And to you, the reader: Thank you for wanting to know my story in my words. I am so grateful to be able to share it thus far.Harry is his lovable self in this book. Honest, sincere, forthright, funny. A rebel with a cause. I loved it. I might be wrong, but I thought the book had a touch of melodrama, uncharacteristic of a British Royal, or highly trained soldier, as though Harry had someone feeding him what he was suppose to say, not what he actually would have said, coming from his background. A feminine touch added. Enough said. Fact is, I WANTED to know Harry's story. His own words. Hopefully there were enough of his own words in this book to make it truly authentic. Hopefully he was allowed to be truly the Captain of his words, as well.For some or other reason, I'm not so convinced. It was nevertheless a warm, good experience.Sela.Show more",5,"Oh the pathosTruly I am so proud of Prince Harry for standing up for his rights and believes What more can one say Harry My family had declared me a nullity The SparePa and William could never be on the same flight together because there must be no chance of the first and second in line to the throne being wiped out But no one gave a damn whom I traveled with the Spare could always be spared I knew this knew my place so why go out of my way to study it Why memorize the names of past spares What was the sens in thatMore why trace my family tree when all tracery led to the same severed branch Mummy

Rating 5 out of 5,"This book needs no introduction. Spare is the highly anticipated memoir of Britain’s Prince Henry. Harry tells the story of his life. Beginning with the untimely death of his mother to the present. Full disclosure, As an American, I am not one to care very much about the royal family. However, I am a lover of stories especially ones told by those that are very different from myself. I enjoy learning something new from those perspectives. Put all of your preconceived notions away going into this one. It’s easy to assume that Spare’s intentions are for the world to pity him and to speak about how ‘tough’ his life has been. That’s not the case. Spare is a reflection simply of Harry’s thoughts and feelings about important events in his life. Harry is humble and well aware of his privilege. It’s easy to assume that Harry is just another pretentious spoiled royal but in Spare, Harry is quite the opposite. Spare evoked a flurry of emotions inside of me. At times the story made me smile but at others it made me tear up. It's hard to listen to Spare and not develop empathy for Harry. I couldn't imagine not only living my life in the public eye with every single thing I did being judged by the public but also never being able to make a decision for myself and instead having every decision being made for me. And to answer everyone’s burning question, is there any dirt dished out on his royal relatives? Yes, but nothing too damning. As I stated earlier, I knew almost nothing about the royal family going into this one so what I felt may have been a shocking revelation may be something that most of the public is already aware of. I really enjoyed this story and I think a lot of people will enjoy it. If you decide to pick up a copy of Spare, I highly recommend checking out the audiobook version which is read by Harry himself.Show more",5,This book needs no introduction Spare is the highly anticipated memoir of Britains Prince Henry Harry tells the story of his life Beginning with the untimely death of his mother to the present Full disclosure As an American I am not one to care very much about the royal family However I am a lover of stories especially ones told by those that are very different from myself I enjoy learning something new from those perspectives Put all of your preconceived notions away going into this one Its easy to assume that Spares intentions are for the world to pity him and to speak about how tough his life has been Thats not the case Spare is a reflection simply of Harrys thoughts and feelings about important events in his life Harry is humble and well aware of his privilege Its easy to assume that Harry is just another pretentious spoiled royal but in Spare Harry is quite the opposite Spare evoked a flurry of emotions inside of me At times the story made me smile but at others it made me tear up Its hard to listen to Spare and not develop empathy for Harry I couldnt imagine not only living my life in the public eye with every single thing I did being judged by the public but also never being able to make a decision for myself and instead having every decision being made for me And to answer everyones burning question is there any dirt dished out on his royal relatives Yes but nothing too damning As I stated earlier I knew almost nothing about the royal family going into this one so what I felt may have been a shocking revelation may be something that most of the public is already aware of I really enjoyed this story and I think a lot of people will enjoy it If you decide to pick up a copy of Spare I highly recommend checking out the audiobook version which is read by Harry himselfShow more

Rating 4 out of 5,"In Spare, Prince Harry—with ghostwriter J. R. Moehringer—tells the story of his life thus far, as a member of the British royal family who was once third in line to the throne, a military officer who did two tours in Afghanistan, and now a California resident, philanthropist, husband, and father. When this memoir was first announced, I expected a repetition of remarks he has made in interviews since leaving England with his family three years ago. I was surprised to find an often intimate and candid, occasionally TMI, 400+ page account of what it was like to grow up in the public eye and struggle to find senses of purpose, normality, and sanity as well as love within the confines of the monarchy.The book is primary divided into three parts, named after lines from the famous William Ernest Henley poem “Invictus”:* Part 1, “Out of the Night That Covers Me” covers Late Summer 1997 to Spring 2006 and mainly discusses Prince Harry’s inability to accept and process his mother’s death, his time as a student at Ludgrove School and then Eton, teenaged hijinks, his gap year working in Australia and Lesotho, and officer training.* Part 2, “Bloody, But Unbowed,” takes place in 2007 to early 2016 and primarily goes over his military career; his post-traumatic stress-induced panic attacks, anxiety, and agoraphobia; his separate adventures to the North and South Poles; the difficulties of dating as a public figure and tabloid target; and the loneliness of bachelorhood.* Part 3, “Captain of My Soul,” is set in Summer 2016 through Summer 2021 and recounts his romance with Meghan, tensions with family during wedding planning and newlywed life, the frightening intrusiveness and racist and dishonest reporting of the media, his and his wife’s mental health struggles, the stepping back from royal roles, their growing family, and the move to North America.Now, is Spare worth a read? I think so. The book gives a fascinating look behind the royal curtain as well as allows Prince Harry the opportunity to address the major controversies of his life, including the Nazi uniform costume, drug use, “Paki” comment, and strip billiards in Las Vegas. I do admit that he gets long-winded at times, and his anger towards the paparazzi and British media—while much deserved—sometimes is awkwardly expressed and overdone. Also, there are some details and anecdotes I feel are overshares and I wish I could unread. (All I’m going to say is: frostbite.) But the memoir… I don’t feel like “humanizes” is the right term to use here, as he is a prince who lived and continues to live a privileged life. The book gives Prince Harry more dimension. It adds color and shape to his profile. While anger and resentment make frequent appearances in the pages—in relation to not only the media but also his complicated relationships with his brother, father, and stepmother—it’s the moments of heartache, loneliness, and tenderness that really resonate. This was a person who longed for affection, for a true, pure sense of family, and then found these things for himself beyond palace walls. These moments were not the juicy excerpts that the press leaked to the public ahead of the book’s official release, but they are, in my opinion, the heart and soul of Spare.Show more",4,In Spare Prince Harrywith ghostwriter J R Moehringertells the story of his life thus far as a member of the British royal family who was once third in line to the throne a military officer who did two tours in Afghanistan and now a California resident philanthropist husband and father When this memoir was first announced I expected a repetition of remarks he has made in interviews since leaving England with his family three years ago I was surprised to find an often intimate and candid occasionally TMI 400 page account of what it was like to grow up in the public eye and struggle to find senses of purpose normality and sanity as well as love within the confines of the monarchyThe book is primary divided into three parts named after lines from the famous William Ernest Henley poem Invictus Part 1 Out of the Night That Covers Me covers Late Summer 1997 to Spring 2006 and mainly discusses Prince Harrys inability to accept and process his mothers death his time as a student at Ludgrove School and then Eton teenaged hijinks his gap year working in Australia and Lesotho and officer training Part 2 Bloody But Unbowed takes place in 2007 to early 2016 and primarily goes over his military career his posttraumatic stressinduced panic attacks anxiety and agoraphobia his separate adventures to the North and South Poles the difficulties of dating as a public figure and tabloid target and the loneliness of bachelorhood Part 3 Captain of My Soul is set in Summer 2016 through Summer 2021 and recounts his romance with Meghan tensions with family during wedding planning and newlywed life the frightening intrusiveness and racist and dishonest reporting of the media his and his wifes mental health struggles the stepping back from royal roles their growing family and the move to North AmericaNow is Spare worth a read I think so The book gives a fascinating look behind the royal curtain as well as allows Prince Harry the opportunity to address the major controversies of his life including the Nazi uniform costume drug use Paki comment and strip billiards in Las Vegas I do admit that he gets longwinded at times and his anger towards the paparazzi and British mediawhile much deservedsometimes is awkwardly expressed and overdone Also there are some details and anecdotes I feel are overshares and I wish I could unread All Im going to say is frostbite But the memoir I dont feel like humanizes is the right term to use here as he is a prince who lived and continues to live a privileged life The book gives Prince Harry more dimension It adds color and shape to his profile While anger and resentment make frequent appearances in the pagesin relation to not only the media but also his complicated relationships with his brother father and stepmotherits the moments of heartache loneliness and tenderness that really resonate This was a person who longed for affection for a true pure sense of family and then found these things for himself beyond palace walls These moments were not the juicy excerpts that the press leaked to the public ahead of the books official release but they are in my opinion the heart and soul of SpareShow more

Rating 2 out of 5,"I was primed to enjoy Spare. Of all the royals, my opinion of Harry is the highest (although I'll admit that's not saying much...I'm a staunch republican). He seemed the most genuine and down-to-earth of the lot, and this book definitely tries very hard for the ""everyman"" approach. But, despite going into this book with a great deal of sympathy for what I've seen the media put Harry through, especially recently, I ended the book with a significantly lower opinion of him than when I started.Spare is a book whose only narrative is hatred of the press. While I can understand from where that hatred stems, that hatred is used as a crutch throughout. It becomes easier for Harry to blame the ""bad"" press than take any time to interrogate his own actions, or the fundamentally abusive relationship he has with his family. It comes across as very ""royals good, press bad,"" without any true analysis of the situation that has created that reality. The book itself, while well-written, is obviously padded. Having worked as a ghostwriter myself for nearly a decade, there were telltale signs I recognised. It was filled with a lot of pointless waffle, irrelevant sentences, and editorialising you wouldn't see in a self-written autobiography. There are two perfect examples early in the book. On page 38, Harry talks about his Mother's funeral, a moment that should be emotional and poignant. 
Farther down the line I spied Ginger Spice, the only Spice with whom I felt any connection—a fellow ginger.
This quote doesn't fit the tone of the moment at all; it's the kind of thing someone says to fill a silence. And by now, I'm sure everyone has heard about the ""BrainQuote.com"" line, which is another prime example.I found this obvious content padding to be a constant throughout Spare, and it really took me out of it. The result was a book that could have been at least 200 pages shorter. It would definitely have been better served with a good old prune, to make it tighter and a bit more fast-paced. The book dragging and being overlong didn't do Harry any favours, and had it been a bit more succinct, the negative parts may not have been quite so glaring.Due to the overwhelming length of Spare, it becomes abundantly clear how much Harry plays the perpetual victim, only ever doing surface-level self-reflection. Everything is always someone else's fault. The infamous Nazi incident is a prime example. 
More than a birthday party, it was a fancy-dress party, with a cringy theme. Natives and colonials. Guests were required to dress accordingly
The emphasis in the above quote comes directly from the book. But the choice to wear that uniform was Harry's, and his alone. And while he does take a degree of responsibility, it is only in so far as to paint himself in a more positive light. He blames the event on the ignorance of his privilege, on his brother and Kate, on the sensational reporting of the press, but also expects a pat on the back for his family forcing him to speak to a Rabbi and do some personal growth after the event. That he did learn from the experience, I have no doubt, but the entire event is painted as someone else's fault, and Harry, merely a poor victim of ignorance and circumstance. Another thing that struck me is how painfully unaware Harry seems about his privilege. The narrative is constructed to present him as the ""everyman"". He's just like you and me! He does his groceries at Waitrose and shops at TK Maxx! But this is all reported without once interrogating the fact that Harry lives in palaces rent free, and receives a clothing allowance. Sure, his father may hold the purse strings, and Harry does make a good point about never having the opportunity to gain financial independence, however, that does not negate the immense privilege he has. A prime example of Harry's ignorance to his privilege is when he laments that he and Megan had to tighten the purse strings because the Royal family will no longer provide them with private security. 
Exactly then, while we were revising our budget, word came down: Pa was cutting me off!
At the beginning of the next chapter, a page or so later, he then talks about getting enough money together to buy a mansion with a Koi pond because it was cheap!
We found a place. Priced at a speed discount. Just up the coast, outside Santa Barbara. Lots of room, large gardens, a climbing frame—even a pond with koi carp.The koi were stressed, the estate agent warned.So are we. We'll all get along famously.No, the agent explained, the koi need very particular care. You'll have to hire a koi guy.Uh-huh. And where does one find a koi guy?The agent wasn't sure.We laughed. First-world problems.
I also took exception to how Harry talks about some of his other interests. He talks about hunting in terms of conservation; something that has been disproved time and time again. It's just an excuse the rich people use to kill things. He also talks about his military career as a service, and yet once again fails to interrogate the privilege he was afforded. He had his pick of jobs, was given private tuition on his Grandmother's estate, and was airlifted out of any real danger. For someone who hates the press, he doesn't seem to realise how much the press was responsible for obscuring his privilege in the military.
RAF Markham had received dozens of complaints. Sandringham was supposed to be a no-fly zone.All complaints were told: Such is war.
As if Prince Harry getting private pilot lessons at his grandmother's palace somehow counts as a necessity of war...And don't even get me started on the subtle racism displayed throughout when he talks about anyone who isn't white. A big deal was made about his ""Paki"" comment in the press at the time, and it is addressed in this book (although not with any real consideration, except ""the press blew it all out of proportion""), but the subtle undercurrent of racism is the real issue in Spare. He talks about the Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama, referring to him just as ""a bloke who just walked out of a palace and sat under a banyan tree."" He says of the highly contentious Koh-i-Noor diamond, ""Acquired"" by the British Empire at its zenith. Solen, some thought."" And when he talks about the Gurkhas, they come across as mascots.
At Sandhurst the Gurkhas always played the enemy in military exercises, which always felt a bit ridiculous because they were beloved
Gee, Harry, I'll give you one guess why that might be...
They had a solemn reverence for royalty. A king, to their minds, was divine...A prince, therefore, wasnt' far off. I'd felt this growing up, but now felt it again.
But what was really missing from Spare was an interrogation of the royal family itself. everything was presented as a family drama, and never a question of whether the institution itself is deeply flawed. While I have some sympathy for Harry, ultimately, his hardships are the result of a self-perpetuating institution that has no aim other than the preservation of their own wealth. It's easy to blame the press. But harder to question how much your privilege has shielded you, or actively caused you harm. The royals are presented as being in league with the press, but it's the press that is the ultimate bad guy. Forget the fact that it's a symbiotic relationship to justify the Royal Family's existence to a public who pays for them. And for me, that's the real sin of this book. Harry's tragedies are all avoidable. The Royal Family aren't necessary, and if anything, Spare proves that the institution is actively harmful, not only to the public, but to the family as well.My Kindle is filled with notes and highlights of some of the abjectly shocking things this book put out into the world, but I have to end this review somewhere. Spare was definitely an interesting read, but it was far too long, and said nothing of any value. It's ultimately a sad tale about an institution that harms everything it touches, and a man too blinded by his own privilege to interrogate his reality.Show more",2,"I was primed to enjoy Spare Of all the royals my opinion of Harry is the highest although Ill admit thats not saying muchIm a staunch republican He seemed the most genuine and downtoearth of the lot and this book definitely tries very hard for the everyman approach But despite going into this book with a great deal of sympathy for what Ive seen the media put Harry through especially recently I ended the book with a significantly lower opinion of him than when I startedSpare is a book whose only narrative is hatred of the press While I can understand from where that hatred stems that hatred is used as a crutch throughout It becomes easier for Harry to blame the bad press than take any time to interrogate his own actions or the fundamentally abusive relationship he has with his family It comes across as very royals good press bad without any true analysis of the situation that has created that reality The book itself while wellwritten is obviously padded Having worked as a ghostwriter myself for nearly a decade there were telltale signs I recognised It was filled with a lot of pointless waffle irrelevant sentences and editorialising you wouldnt see in a selfwritten autobiography There are two perfect examples early in the book On page 38 Harry talks about his Mothers funeral a moment that should be emotional and poignant

Rating 3 out of 5,"Everyone has a strong opinion about the Royals so take my thoughts with a grain of salt. All of our opinions are based on what the media has fed us and that’s clearly part of the problem that Harry and Meghan are facing.Everyone was reading this book and I was happy to join in on all the convos. Is it a must read? Nope and probably nothing new for any fans either.Takeaways - Harry is a sad guy who never really dealt with the grief over losing his mother. He’s definitely doing a better job of that as an adult and Meghan might have something to do with that. I do think there is a clash of cultures going on and that has led to a lot of family misunderstandings. Unfortunately I feel like he wrote this too early and may come to regret it in a few years. There was little self reflection or accountability within the pages. Lastly, Harry is madly in love with Meghan and will do anything to protect her and their children.This memoir could have used some editing and definitely didn’t need the chapters about his todger.

Rating 4 out of 5,"Prince Harry was always the royal that stood out to me the most in the world post-Princess Diana. With that being said, I did preorder this audiobook. Many reviews state that this isn’t well written, and I am confused. Are we reading/listening to the same book? The press did a number on destroying their livelihood with each racist headline at a time. The media took so many situations out of context. I was always so shocked at how Prince Harry was portrayed as the partier and the son that never cared about his duties. But in reality, he was doing everything that was asked of him and then some. When Meghan came into the picture, the monarch cut ties with him? It is so bizarre how they were treated. Harry portrays himself as a person who is breaking generational trauma and a toxic family dynamic. He became the husband that Diana needed, and I love that so much. He might have been trauma-dumping on us, but I can not even begin to imagine how cathartic it felt for him to get it out finally. Prince Harry is pretty high up in my military heroes category, so this might be a completely biased review, but overall it is a great read.Show more",4,Prince Harry was always the royal that stood out to me the most in the world postPrincess Diana With that being said I did preorder this audiobook Many reviews state that this isnt well written and I am confused Are we readinglistening to the same book The press did a number on destroying their livelihood with each racist headline at a time The media took so many situations out of context I was always so shocked at how Prince Harry was portrayed as the partier and the son that never cared about his duties But in reality he was doing everything that was asked of him and then some When Meghan came into the picture the monarch cut ties with him It is so bizarre how they were treated Harry portrays himself as a person who is breaking generational trauma and a toxic family dynamic He became the husband that Diana needed and I love that so much He might have been traumadumping on us but I can not even begin to imagine how cathartic it felt for him to get it out finally Prince Harry is pretty high up in my military heroes category so this might be a completely biased review but overall it is a great readShow more
Rating 5 out of 5,"This is my favorite villain origin story, and I AM HERE FOR IT. We said spill the tea, and Harry said, ""How many cups do you want?"" Let me start off by saying that I do feel bad for Harry. He was born into a life he didn't want, lost his mom when he was on the cusp of puberty, and just lived the weirdest life that lacked affection, tenderness, and normalcy. BUT, he has some serious mummy issues. Like, there are so many strange examples--I'm not just talking about when he got frostbite on his 🍆 and thought of her when given a remedy. Umm...sir? Regardless, I gobbled it up. I found the details of his life interesting because, as an American, there is just simply so much I didn't know about the royal family. I honestly don't think he was that disrespectful to his family, but then again, I'm American, and we are brash, loud, and brutally honest (paraphrasing 😅). I digress. My favorite parts all had to do with his wife, Meghan. ""Trust me. I'll keep you safe."" 🥹 You guys. Say what you will, but that man loooooves his wife. He would burn every bridge for her sake. And it's understandable when you hear some of the things Meghan was feeling and saying to him behind closed doors. Anyway, it was great on audio.

Rating 4 out of 5,"Humble and Brave I’ve never read so many negative reviews on a memoir, but I guess it’s to be expected considering the subject and the role players. I had no idea the BRF was so dysfunctional. I guess it’s safe to say I bought into the PR. After Princess Diana passed, Harry was left to an emotionally stunted, unavailable set of adults. It’s heartbreaking to read that not one of them comforted him in the hour of his greatest loss. Not a word, not a hug. He was left alone for hours and even thereafter institution and procedure were carried out. From then on, I think any reasonable person could see how Harry’s biggest emotional wound has never healed and as such his emotional development was stunted at the age of twelve. He may not have had the emotional resources to make the best decisions but he’s pushed through to the other side and he’s seeking help. As a citizen of the commonwealth, my stance is anti-colonial and anti-imperialist, I can’t help but be skeptical and disappointed in his insistence that the family and British press are plagued by an “unconscious bias” against someone who looks like the people they subjugated for hundreds of years. It’s sad that the family couldn’t (wouldn’t) protect her. And I unlike him am not afraid to call it by its name, racism. I’ll also never give Harry or any member of the royal family credit for the “work” they do in Africa. After pillaging Africa for centuries, that work is not even a drop in the ocean, and I’d venture to say it’s merely performative. Please leave Africa out of your pissing contests. All the same, Harry deserves credit for stepping up, stepping out and making hard choices for his wife and children by putting them first. This book is at times very raw, funny, heartbreaking, and just a truthful purging of his life from his own heart. His love for his mother and his family is very clear in the pages. But so is his love and admiration for his wife. The British press has made billions of pounds from the life and death of his mother. From Harry and William, and their families. It's high time for he told his side of the story and if he can support his family and provide the home, protection, and safety they need, then all the better. Isn’t that what all respectable parents do? I think he’s earned his peace and I wish him nothing but success for the future.Show more",4,Humble and Brave Ive never read so many negative reviews on a memoir but I guess its to be expected considering the subject and the role players I had no idea the BRF was so dysfunctional I guess its safe to say I bought into the PR After Princess Diana passed Harry was left to an emotionally stunted unavailable set of adults Its heartbreaking to read that not one of them comforted him in the hour of his greatest loss Not a word not a hug He was left alone for hours and even thereafter institution and procedure were carried out From then on I think any reasonable person could see how Harrys biggest emotional wound has never healed and as such his emotional development was stunted at the age of twelve He may not have had the emotional resources to make the best decisions but hes pushed through to the other side and hes seeking help As a citizen of the commonwealth my stance is anticolonial and antiimperialist I cant help but be skeptical and disappointed in his insistence that the family and British press are plagued by an unconscious bias against someone who looks like the people they subjugated for hundreds of years Its sad that the family couldnt wouldnt protect her And I unlike him am not afraid to call it by its name racism Ill also never give Harry or any member of the royal family credit for the work they do in Africa After pillaging Africa for centuries that work is not even a drop in the ocean and Id venture to say its merely performative Please leave Africa out of your pissing contests All the same Harry deserves credit for stepping up stepping out and making hard choices for his wife and children by putting them first This book is at times very raw funny heartbreaking and just a truthful purging of his life from his own heart His love for his mother and his family is very clear in the pages But so is his love and admiration for his wife The British press has made billions of pounds from the life and death of his mother From Harry and William and their families Its high time for he told his side of the story and if he can support his family and provide the home protection and safety they need then all the better Isnt that what all respectable parents do I think hes earned his peace and I wish him nothing but success for the futureShow more

Rating 4 out of 5,"“If you mock someone who is obviously hurting, then that’s bullying”, to paraphrase Terry Pratchett. The amount of hate Prince Harry is receiving is disproportionate to his crime of privilege and has all the signs of mob mentality. Harry is the weaker party here and I for one, will root for the underdog. Rather than railing against Harry for revealing so many details and thus putting his royal family in a rather dubious light, consider whether it’s actually true? Harry and Meghan were hounded by the press and his word is that many details were leaked from the palace and that he was actively sabotaged because of jealousy. With a glamorous American actress by his side, it’s not as inconceivable as it’s made out to be.Aside from the salacious details, this book reveals many unknown aspects of the prince and is quite well written. I enjoyed it. Most of it anyway, some of the scenes from Afghanistan I could have done well without. Other parts are shockingly personal - like the frostbite of the Crown Jewels. I will never again quite view the British royal as positively as I had before. At the same time, I kind of pity the golden cage they live in. No amount of privilege is worth the cost of being hunted by paparazzi and bullied by the press.

Rating 3 out of 5,"An ""I'm ambivalent"" 3 Stars…Maybe 3.5 Because The Writing Is Very GoodYeah, so I was curious, and I'd say 50% of my decision was driven by my love of his voice. But why would I want to listen to it for 15hrs when at times it could be very, very hard to like a word coming from dude's mouth, you may ask? I don't know, I really don't. I will say, it's sensitive and touching in many places. I have deep sympathy for every child born into the upper tiers of the Royal Family post c. 1950 because it must be a terrible fishtank to be trapped within for the entirety of one's life. Gilded cages are still cages and all that. It's even highly introspective at times, except not where it matters most, and that is why I can't give this a higher rating. I wished, hoped, he might be willing to critique himself more. Namely regarding the very dark underbelly of colonial entitlement in his musings on ownership of Africa and his military career in Afghanistan to the very fact that his existence is dependent on the relics of one of the most harmful imperial regimes in human history. I know, I know it was a long shot but I have shiny dreams that even British Princes long for a world free of imperialism. But, alas. (Does anyone else hear Dumbledore's voice whenever they encounter the word 'alas'?) For the most part, I did see, and largely agree, with his perspective on the pernicious British press and honestly?

Rating 5 out of 5,"I went into this thinking it’d be more of royals complaining about how hard it is to be famous and I was very quickly humbled and shut up. The writing is so strong. The structure of the short chapters and 3 parts is so organized and purposeful the book just flows. I read uninterrupted for about 6 hours because I was so engrossed in this book.I thought this was going to be a whole “anti-royal family” situation but it’s really not. It’s told really well from Harry’s experiences with losing his mother, joining the army, and trying to navigate his career and social life. None of which has been easy or fair in anyway. I left this book with a WHOLE lot more empathy for Harry and Meghan and a WHOLE lot more hate for Charles and Will. Charles is truly the scum of the earth and should never have been able to have children. Overall, it’s just a really sad story. From ages 0-12 is was all about playing politics between Diana and Charles. Then when Diana died he had to figure out who he was while being left with this distant horrible father, with a brother who is so insecure and competitive about everything that I cannot imagine how they had any type of relationship. Then his passion and career is taken from him and then he’s attacked ruthlessly by the press and his own family. Did I mention Charles is the worst person ever? To get 5 stars from me you really have to make me FEEL. I mean cry, LOL, get excited, etc… and this one just kept me going. Lots of OMGs and NOs and WHATs etc…10/10 absolutely read this right now. Right. Now.Show more",5,I went into this thinking itd be more of royals complaining about how hard it is to be famous and I was very quickly humbled and shut up The writing is so strong The structure of the short chapters and 3 parts is so organized and purposeful the book just flows I read uninterrupted for about 6 hours because I was so engrossed in this bookI thought this was going to be a whole antiroyal family situation but its really not Its told really well from Harrys experiences with losing his mother joining the army and trying to navigate his career and social life None of which has been easy or fair in anyway I left this book with a WHOLE lot more empathy for Harry and Meghan and a WHOLE lot more hate for Charles and Will Charles is truly the scum of the earth and should never have been able to have children Overall its just a really sad story From ages 012 is was all about playing politics between Diana and Charles Then when Diana died he had to figure out who he was while being left with this distant horrible father with a brother who is so insecure and competitive about everything that I cannot imagine how they had any type of relationship Then his passion and career is taken from him and then hes attacked ruthlessly by the press and his own family Did I mention Charles is the worst person ever To get 5 stars from me you really have to make me FEEL I mean cry LOL get excited etc and this one just kept me going Lots of OMGs and NOs and WHATs etc1010 absolutely read this right now Right NowShow more

Rating 4 out of 5,"Alright, just a few notes because why not? •First and most importantly: I am staunchly anti-monarchy, anti-racist, anti-colonial, anti-military, and anti-Crown. The entire anachronistic institution is racist, bigoted, and white supremacist. You will never, ever be able to convince me otherwise. •I listened to this audiobook out of sheer curiosity. I wanted to hear what Harry had to say about his experiences and why he and Meghan left. I’m glad I listened to the audiobook, and it has only reaffirmed what I already knew about the monarchy. •The book wasn’t really shocking. I genuinely don’t follow Royal news, so I didn’t know a lot about the events he spoke about except for their wedding, their exit from their Royal duties, and the Queen’s death. I DID learn a lot (too much?) about Harry’s frost bitten penis. •Harry has started something good: a pulling back of the curtains on the effects of the relentlessness of the press, the true treatment of the royals behind closed doors (from fellow royals), and the archaic rules and modes of operation to which the crown adheres. I hope it is the beginning of the end for the Crown. Long overdue. •And for those whinging about how Haz & Meg want “privacy” but are putting out media (Netflix doc, Oprah interview, book, etc.) please sit down. Privacy from paparazzi and curated, mostly false, stories from the palace are a totally different beast than reclaiming your story and sharing it on your terms. •I like Markle and won’t be tolerating even a hint of the misogynoir that has been launched at her consistently since she and Haz got together. Do I recommend the book? Yes and no. It’s not some scandalous tell all which is what I think people are hoping for. But I think it’s honest and self-reflective - with many indications that Harry needs to do more deep thinking and (un)learning. Its a little slow in part 2, and there are some TWs to be aware of which I will list here. This isn’t exhaustive; I’ve done my best: hunting animals, death of animals, discussion of poaching, death of a parent, description of war and militarism, discussion of PTSD, suicidal ideation, depression, drug & alcohol use, miscarriage, & exploitation. I gave it 4 stars and I base that on the writing, pacing, & structure. I’m aware he had a ghost writer. And the fact that so many Goodreads users rated this a 1 star book without even reading it?

Rating 4 out of 5,"How do I even write a review of this memoir? I am not sure, but I will do my best. I am still blown away by various aspects of this memoir and processing it all. It was A LOT; in fact, Harry did MENTION IT ALL. Truly. It starts with his childhood, the untimely death of his mother, his formative years, boarding school, his troubled teens and young adulthood, the military, and of course, his time with Meghan. Although the Meghan chapters are very small compared to the rest of the novel, so it's very clear that this is HIS story. This is his version of the truth. I think it's important to remember that when going into it. There are two sides to every story and while Harry is sharing his, we will never know William or Charles's despite the fact that he believes they speak through the media. Nonetheless, Harry does make some damning points and some accusations that the Royal Family, in my opinion, won't recover from.

Rating 5 out of 5,"Since Prince Harry’s 2017 interview with Bryony Gordon, I’ve been hoping he would talk more about his mental health struggles. He does in SPARE.When a celebrity is open about battles with anxiety and depression, it smashes apart stigma and shame and makes a world of difference to families like mine. It also takes a great deal of courage.I’m drawn to memoirs about anxiety and grief, and this one is a stand-out for me. I know Prince Harry had a ghost writer, and yes, the writing is gorgeous, but I listened to the audiobook, and he’s a fantastic narrator.At the heart of his story is a broken, lost child who never processed his mother’s death. For years, he reframed it as a disappearance and imagined her in hiding. One day, he wanted to believe, she would send for him and his brother. It’s clear that even now, his mother is a guiding force in his life.So many times I wondered how different this story would have been if someone—anyone—had taken the young prince to a therapist or a grief counselor. How can a twelve-year-old make sense of a parent’s violent death without professional help?Prince Harry is open about his drug use, his panic attacks, the therapy he eventually sort as an adult, and his anger (the red mist). He doesn’t gloss over the backlash of questionable decisions—yes, everyone in England remembers the Nazi uniform he wore to a costume party—or his hatred of the paparazzi.His descriptions of trips to Africa and his time in the British military are gripping, and I was fascinated by his determination to launch what would become the Invictus Games. Throughout, he’s clearly kept a band of good ‘mates’, but there has been much tragedy in his life. His best friend from school, like his mother, died in a car wreck.In the chapters that cover his father’s and Prince William’s weddings, it’s obvious how insecure Harry felt at both moments—as if terrified he would be even more alone. I find that heartbreaking, especially when he talks about how much he wanted to settle down and start a family.But then he meets Meghan Markle (and eventually her dog) … and they fall madly in love. The stories of their dates before the press found out they were a couple are ridiculously sweet, including the time they went grocery shopping in disguise. But their fairy tale quickly became a nightmare.I’m not sure why anyone would be surprised they wanted out. People forget that Princess Diana did, too. I still remember news reports about how, “If only she’d kept her royal protection, she would be alive.” Nothing shocked me more in this book than learning how Harry and Meghan’s protection was yanked without warning—despite ongoing death threats.I hope they find their happily-ever-after; I hope they continue to do good in the world; and I hope Harry finds the peace that eluded his mother, a woman I admired. I was outside the hospital on the day she made history by shaking an ungloved hand with an AIDS patient. A simple act that also challenged stigma.Show more",5,Since Prince Harrys 2017 interview with Bryony Gordon Ive been hoping he would talk more about his mental health struggles He does in SPAREWhen a celebrity is open about battles with anxiety and depression it smashes apart stigma and shame and makes a world of difference to families like mine It also takes a great deal of courageIm drawn to memoirs about anxiety and grief and this one is a standout for me I know Prince Harry had a ghost writer and yes the writing is gorgeous but I listened to the audiobook and hes a fantastic narratorAt the heart of his story is a broken lost child who never processed his mothers death For years he reframed it as a disappearance and imagined her in hiding One day he wanted to believe she would send for him and his brother Its clear that even now his mother is a guiding force in his lifeSo many times I wondered how different this story would have been if someoneanyonehad taken the young prince to a therapist or a grief counselor How can a twelveyearold make sense of a parents violent death without professional helpPrince Harry is open about his drug use his panic attacks the therapy he eventually sort as an adult and his anger the red mist He doesnt gloss over the backlash of questionable decisionsyes everyone in England remembers the Nazi uniform he wore to a costume partyor his hatred of the paparazziHis descriptions of trips to Africa and his time in the British military are gripping and I was fascinated by his determination to launch what would become the Invictus Games Throughout hes clearly kept a band of good mates but there has been much tragedy in his life His best friend from school like his mother died in a car wreckIn the chapters that cover his fathers and Prince Williams weddings its obvious how insecure Harry felt at both momentsas if terrified he would be even more alone I find that heartbreaking especially when he talks about how much he wanted to settle down and start a familyBut then he meets Meghan Markle and eventually her dog  and they fall madly in love The stories of their dates before the press found out they were a couple are ridiculously sweet including the time they went grocery shopping in disguise But their fairy tale quickly became a nightmareIm not sure why anyone would be surprised they wanted out People forget that Princess Diana did too I still remember news reports about how If only shed kept her royal protection she would be alive Nothing shocked me more in this book than learning how Harry and Meghans protection was yanked without warningdespite ongoing death threatsI hope they find their happilyeverafter I hope they continue to do good in the world and I hope Harry finds the peace that eluded his mother a woman I admired I was outside the hospital on the day she made history by shaking an ungloved hand with an AIDS patient A simple act that also challenged stigmaShow more
Rating 3 out of 5,"I've always liked Harry, and I think he and Meghan make an admirable couple. They look so happy as if truly each other's soul mate, and I trust they'll try to do good in the world. This book confirmed that for me. However, even though I'd heard the sniping about his brother and other family members during Harry's many tv interviews, it really distressed me that that was what he felt he needed to resort to. I wholeheartedly agree that the paparazzi needs to be quelled and perhaps Harry will some day achieve that. But at the expense of his family may not be the way to go about it. Those words will be hard to forget even after a time.

Rating 3 out of 5,"I knew almost nothing about the issues surrounding Harry and Meghan’s withdrawal from the British royal family—I didn’t see the Oprah interview and don’t get Netflix so haven’t seen their series—so my curiosity about what went on behind the scenes led me to snap this up as soon as it dropped at the Toronto library. (I’m clearly not alone: there are about 4,000 people on the wait lists at that library alone for  each  of the ebook, audio and hardback versions.) Whoa. I got more than I bargained for. It was a front-row seat to some eye-popping stuff. What I came away with from this is the impression that the royals seem just a bunch of puppets for the courtiers at the palace who are the ones actually pulling the strings. According to Harry, the level of life-threatening racist vitriol aimed at Meghan by the great unwashed was dangerous and unprecedented, aided and abetted by the British tabloid press. And in spite of repeated pleas from Harry, the only response from the palace and members of his family was a deafening silence—when they weren’t actually planting nasty stories in the press about Meghan themselves to further their own ends. No one except Elizabeth comes off well. Charles is weak and he and Camilla are overly concerned that no one else in the family outshine them in terms of positive press attention. William is a petulant jerk, a case of sibling rivalry run amok. Pettiness abounds everywhere. (I’ve always been outraged as a Canadian that our head of state is a foreign-born hereditary monarch, and the revelations here are just adding fuel to that fire.)Early indications are that this will be a publishing behemoth, which should achieve what I suspect is one of Harry’s main goals in putting the book out there.

Rating 1 out of 5,"“Am I the right person to tell this story?” “Am I in the right mind-set to write this book?” “Do I have enough peace in my life in order to look at things objectively?” “Have I gained enough to maturity in order to not just judge but also understand the actions of others?” Just some of the questions Prince Harry should have asked himself before engaging on this project. If “right” and “truth” were the things he indeed sought. Alas, at the time he dediced to write Spare not only did he not ask himself these things but as it turned out his answers were actually “No”, “No”, “No” and “No”. No, he doesn’t understand the actions of others. He doesn’t understand the actions of his own family. Nor does he make an effort. At everything his brother does, Harry suspects a self interest. Not once does he think: “hey, could it be that my brother is right about this?” “Could it be that he doesn’t take this action out of spite?”. There’s not one tender scene in the book featuring them. Or Harry and Charles. Even the one with the Queen is set in the epilogue. My mind kept on wandering to Tara Westover’s Educated. Tara, unlike Harry, was actually threatened by her brother. Her life was literally on the line due to the actions of her father. She was physically abused by her brother. A.k.a badly beaten. Still, in her memoir, she does manage to include tender brother-sister moments. It’s not all bad with her dad. No matter how sick and twisted her family was and became, you still feel, as a reader, that at some point they cared for each other. You don’t get that from Harry’s narrative. And sure, maybe it’s the fault of the family who clearly struggles with love and emotions. But Harry claims he has them. He claims he loves his brother. Claims that for several years he was devoted to him. And yet, no kind words, nothing suggesting a brotherly bond is presented in the book. Nor did he gain enough maturity to tackle such a project. A 30 year old man who is asking himself “what could I have done?” when two other friends climb on top of his 2 person jetski, inevitably ending in a water filled with crocodiles, is everything but mature. Because as a grown-up, you either have the balls to actually tell your friends it’s irresponsible to go in the water like that. Or, you simply choose to not bother with safety. Pointing fingers at the others that did the wrong and asking yourself “what could I have done?” implying “they made me do it” it’s simply childish. And so it’s consuming your wife’s laughing gas while she is the one in labour, for that matter. As for peace? He has no peace. Not with himself, not with the past, not with the present. He is in constant war mode: with his family, with the paparazzi. So blinded he doesn’t even see how absurd his actions are. Complaining about fabricated stories regarding substance abuse and then describing in SO many of the chapters which drugs he used and which drinks got him intoxicated? A lot of his remarks regarding his family are straightforward mean. Yes, William is balding. Is it a choice? Can he stop getting old? Is it nice and kind of Harry to point it out? Is it kind to ridicule your 70+ father’s back routine? He said he went to therapy. I say: not enough. I think a big part of the book is simply scary when you ponder how unstable Harry actually is. In all fairness, his action of publishing a book looked good on paper. And much needed. Because the Royal Family is disfunctional. And sorry, but it should not serve as a role-model for anybody. And the System/Firm is horrid. And did make horrible things. But Spare is far from what was needed in order to change something.It’s not properly researched, it’s poorly written, it’s too judgemental. He often calls his memories unreliable. Still, he never questions his perspectives on things. It’s a sad book. It’s a missed opportunity. .Show more",1,Am I the right person to tell this story Am I in the right mindset to write this book Do I have enough peace in my life in order to look at things objectively Have I gained enough to maturity in order to not just judge but also understand the actions of others Just some of the questions Prince Harry should have asked himself before engaging on this project If right and truth were the things he indeed sought Alas at the time he dediced to write Spare not only did he not ask himself these things but as it turned out his answers were actually No No No and No No he doesnt understand the actions of others He doesnt understand the actions of his own family Nor does he make an effort At everything his brother does Harry suspects a self interest Not once does he think hey could it be that my brother is right about this Could it be that he doesnt take this action out of spite Theres not one tender scene in the book featuring them Or Harry and Charles Even the one with the Queen is set in the epilogue My mind kept on wandering to Tara Westovers Educated Tara unlike Harry was actually threatened by her brother Her life was literally on the line due to the actions of her father She was physically abused by her brother Aka badly beaten Still in her memoir she does manage to include tender brothersister moments Its not all bad with her dad No matter how sick and twisted her family was and became you still feel as a reader that at some point they cared for each other You dont get that from Harrys narrative And sure maybe its the fault of the family who clearly struggles with love and emotions But Harry claims he has them He claims he loves his brother Claims that for several years he was devoted to him And yet no kind words nothing suggesting a brotherly bond is presented in the book Nor did he gain enough maturity to tackle such a project A 30 year old man who is asking himself what could I have done when two other friends climb on top of his 2 person jetski inevitably ending in a water filled with crocodiles is everything but mature Because as a grownup you either have the balls to actually tell your friends its irresponsible to go in the water like that Or you simply choose to not bother with safety Pointing fingers at the others that did the wrong and asking yourself what could I have done implying they made me do it its simply childish And so its consuming your wifes laughing gas while she is the one in labour for that matter As for peace He has no peace Not with himself not with the past not with the present He is in constant war mode with his family with the paparazzi So blinded he doesnt even see how absurd his actions are Complaining about fabricated stories regarding substance abuse and then describing in SO many of the chapters which drugs he used and which drinks got him intoxicated A lot of his remarks regarding his family are straightforward mean Yes William is balding Is it a choice Can he stop getting old Is it nice and kind of Harry to point it out Is it kind to ridicule your 70 fathers back routine He said he went to therapy I say not enough I think a big part of the book is simply scary when you ponder how unstable Harry actually is In all fairness his action of publishing a book looked good on paper And much needed Because the Royal Family is disfunctional And sorry but it should not serve as a rolemodel for anybody And the SystemFirm is horrid And did make horrible things But Spare is far from what was needed in order to change somethingIts not properly researched its poorly written its too judgemental He often calls his memories unreliable Still he never questions his perspectives on things Its a sad book Its a missed opportunity Show more

Rating 4 out of 5,"The Disney princess fantasy: be cute, bat your eyes at a prince (or get into some sort of mortal danger from which you must be saved), marry, and live happily ever after. Those Disney tales don't really tell the bad things, though. Being a royal means you are born, raised, existing, and dying in a bubble. If not born into it, you might marry into it. You can't go on vacation, buy groceries, have dinner with friends, or even walk down the street without constant harassment. In this particular royal family, hugs and kisses don't exist, kids get shipped off to boarding school during their entire childhood and adolescence only to come home for holidays, kids are often bullied for being royal by jealous classmates, and no one is there to really guide them into adulthood - to teach them how to be functioning members of a society. They are taught only how to exist within that bubble. Through no choice of their own, people are born into this whether their personality suits it or not and must figure out how to deal with it. Some do better than others.Let me write first on the content and overall theme of this book. I'll get to some other stuff later.Harry is one who didn't do well with the bubble. His grandmother was the queen, his father was next in line behind her, his brother next in line behind their father, and his mother was arguably the most famous and most beloved woman in the world. Harry was way down the pecking order in the family. Then his parents divorced, which was unheard of for someone high up on the succession list. Then his mother tragically died, and Harry age 12 (along with William age 15) was literally forced by senior family members to walk behind his mother's coffin for more than 30 minutes on its way to Westminster Abbey ""to garner public sympathy"". Afterwards, they left him with no counseling, no therapy, no hugs, and sent him back to boarding school. School happened, where we see the first rift in the brotherhood bond between him and Will. Harry remains full of anger almost all the time and self medicates with alcohol and other substances. He joined the army and found a bit of purpose. He finally found something he was good at, and did two tours in Afghanistan. During this time he dated and lost several people due to the intense media scrutiny and time away at war. Rage was still boiling just under the surface. He eventually left the army, got his life together, met Meghan, and lived happily ever after.Just kidding! Harry had to go through lots of therapy, sue some tabloids on behalf of Meghan, deal with complete and utter trash from his family, and make some hard decisions.Content-wise, this book is worth reading. I completely believe nearly everything he wrote here. If I am wrong and the content is only 50% correct, then it is still really bad. Yes, Harry has lived a very privileged life. Yes, some things he wrote here are really insensitive and clueless. But I think, as far as being someone in the top 5 successors, he wasn't all that privileged as far as royals go. He lived with his father until he was 30-ish because his father controlled the money. Most of that money went toward clothing and security (required for his royal duties that he had to perform whether he wanted to or not). Did he know at the time that wearing a Nazi uniform to a costume party was a bad idea? Probably not, especially when Will and Kate supported that decision. And no one in his family or his bubble would have ever seen a problem with it either. I think Harry had to sit down with himself and decide did he want to write some of this content, because it is MESSY. He has burned bridges that probably won't ever be repaired. Charles and Camilla (power hungry, trying to get as much positive press for themselves even to the detriment of the rest of the family), Will and Kate (very proper and by-the-books, even getting aggressive and violent at times in their wish not to rock the boat), senior members of the palace staff, Will's staff, his own staff, and the British media. I personally saw all the media craziness around Meghan. That wasn't behind closed doors, that was right out there on the newstands. So, the racism and sexism and death threats were very very public and very very scary. Harry's pleas to correct the media statements fell on deaf ears. There is even one case where a family member came to Meghan and said something to the effect of, ""I know what they said is false. You didn't make me cry; I made you cry. But we can't ask them to retract that statement because then I would look bad in the eyes of the media. And I am the future of the monarchy."" Meghan even miscarried during this terrible time. Still, when Harry and Meghan made several different attempts to stay within the family and continue to perform service for the family while living in other commonwealth nations for their own safety, (New Zealand, South Africa, Canada) and every single one was leaked to the press by the only two people they told (Charles and Camilla), it's almost like the family wanted them to exit and did everything they could to make that happen.Content-wise, I am happy with the book. It fed my need for voyeurism into the lives of people who mostly stay behind closed doors. And I am okay with downvoting any review or comment that says something like ""He is shameful for airing dirty laundry and treating his family this way"", because the media and his own family treated him like a circus attraction his entire life, printing rumors and lies nearly constantly. He has a right to set the record straight, royal or not.The writing is not good, though. It is obvious he had at least 2, maybe 3, ghostwriters. It isn't fluid. Clearly, Harry wrote or narrated some anecdotes and some feelings he experienced. Gave some great detail, too. Clearly, also, there were several other writers who kept bringing in the theme of his mother and the coffin and the bubble. Harry, sadly, doesn't seem exceptionally bright so I don't think he could have pulled this off on his own. It makes it a bit disjointed. We go from Harry not crying over his mother's death for many years and having so much repressed anger and anxiety, to a frostbitten penis during a trip to the North Pole. I know this review is long enough already, but I have one other thing to get off my mind. Here's the main reason I know Harry is telling the truth. Harry fell in love with and married a biracial woman, the first non-white in the royal family. With all the unrest in the Commonwealth nations and the insecurity of the monarchy as a whole, Harry and Meghan's official visit to the African Commonwealth nations was an overwhelming success. They loved her. It would have been smart for the royal family to use that to their advantage, as a positive PR move to garner some love and loyalty for the monarchy. But I think we know who didn't like, and consequently tore down, the last person who was more popular than someone in the line of succession.Personal opinion: both Charles and Camilla need to burn in hell some day.

Rating 5 out of 5,"Everyone deserves to tell their story, in their own words, and especially, perhaps more so, after years and years of others telling their stories of you. This memoir of Prince Harry's tells his story, covering his life from the time of his mother's death to present. It is unflinching and raw, celebrating the good things and not glazing over the bad. It is also deeply sad, and as the reader, I couldn't help but empathize with Harry as he is basically left alone to grapple with his mother's death and never truly heals from that.

Rating 4 out of 5,"As a little girl, I was never into princess shit and never indulged in the fantasy of becoming one.Maybe young me had a sixth sense and knew royalty life was mostly bullshit and garbage.WHEW. This was quite a read. I know it's received some widely varying reviews, even just among my own Goodreads friends. I will just start out by saying that overall I enjoyed the reading experience, and was engaged with it most of the time, and think that in the main it was brave for him to put this out there. There has been such a torrent of lies and half-truths and smears and so on about him in the press, for his whole entire life, that I can imagine getting his truth in front of people's eyes would've felt basically like a necessity. I mean, most of us are aware that tabloids and magazines and some newspapers can and do lie, but I think we tend to think of it more as like ""twisting the facts"" or embellishing them or whatnot. Instead of just flat-out, bald-faced, 100% lies. (Well, except Fox and its clones. They couldn't exist without flat-out, bald-faced, 100% lies!) The frustration that would be caused by seeing words attributed to you that you never said, things you never did, etc, would be bad enough, but then to have your family--the most powerful family in the country, and one of the most powerful in the world--be like ""Eh, whatev"" would just be downright maddening.I think it's also very valuable to see all of the reprehensible and cruel shit that Meghan endured from their side, and to see their endless and futile efforts to try to get the Palace to do something, anything, about it. And when they tried to say ""Oh well, you know, they've done the same to this person and that person"", it was almost laughably obtuse the way they conveniently ignored the racial aspect. Yes, the press said nasty things about Camilla and Kate, but it was nowhere near the level of hatred and vitriol they flung at Meghan, largely because of her skin color. So I went into this with a lot of empathy for Harry and Meghan, and still feel that way, for sure. I will certainly say though that there are some aspects to the book that are rough. When you're only getting one person's take on a situation or conversation or something, it's impossible to know if you're getting the whole truth or an accurate picture. There are a lot of times when Harry infers someone's mindset or emotions or thoughts from their facial expressions or body language or something, and like, sure, this is your family, you can probably deduce those things fairly well. But you're not a mind-reader, and you're also approaching the recollection of these memories from a sensitive place. Would the other people agree with how they were characterized all the time? Likely not. Doesn't make it either true or untrue, but it's necessary to take one person's assessment of another's state of mind with a grain of salt. There were also certain things that were kind of petty and didn't really feel essential to include, but seemed to be done so just to be a bit of a messy bitch. Like, commenting about William's early balding, or the lip gloss thing, and some others. Particularly with regard to William, the whole thing about the Heir and the Spare felt one-sided. Yes, I can absolutely see how it would feel pretty shitty to know that you're viewed as literally less important than your sibling, that you only really matter to the family if something were to happen to them. But there wasn't really any honest recognition of what being ""the Heir"" might feel like, and having all of this massive pressure and expectation put on you from birth. Harry was able to step away from royal life; William had zero choice. There's no way they would've ever let him do the same thing if he'd wanted to. He was also put into a crappy role with no say in the matter--just because his role seems cushier on the outside doesn't mean it didn't also come with its own downsides.There were other things that rubbed me the wrong way a bit too--Harry's seeming buck-passing when it came to his stupid SS officer costume; him and William arguing about who gets to have Africa as their ""thing""; Harry's ignorance, even as got older, of what he was asking of any woman he wanted to date. While Harry does at a few points briefly call out the colonialism and imperialistic history of the monarchy, it's rather tepid, and it would've been nice to see a stronger voice on that issue. Also, I could've done with less about his time in the Army. I know it was a hugely important part of his life, but it got way too nitty-gritty for me personally.But. Like I said, overall this was very interesting, in the most literal and non-negging sense of the word. It kept me engaged (except during the military shit) and it was very eye-opening about a lot of things. The early part especially, leading up to and in the aftermath of his mother's death, was incredibly moving and made me sad for him and his brother all over again. I was 17 when Princess Diana was killed, and I remember it vividly. I specifically remember the scene Harry describes of him and William walking behind her coffin, and thinking that it must have been so incredibly difficult for them to do so in front of millions of people. Knowing that they were basically forced into it and also that they weren't supposed to show any emotional signs of grief, while also being expected to comfort strangers, just made the whole thing even more stark. I think this is worth the read if you have any interest in the whole situation, and for all of his and the book's flaws, I do still think it was a bold move to put it out there. And I just hope he has the sense not to read reviews.Show more",4,As a little girl I was never into princess shit and never indulged in the fantasy of becoming oneMaybe young me had a sixth sense and

Harry was able to step away from royal life William had zero choice Theres no way they wouldve ever let him do the same thing if hed wanted to He was also put into a crappy role with no say in the matterjust because his role seems cushier on the outside doesnt mean it didnt also come with its own downsidesThere were other things that rubbed me the wrong way a bit tooHarrys seeming buckpassing when it came to his stupid SS officer costume him and William arguing about who gets to have Africa as their thing Harrys ignorance even as got older of what he was asking of any woman he wanted to date While Harry does at a few points briefly call out the colonialism and imperialistic history of the monarchy its rather tepid and it wouldve been nice to see a stronger voice on that issue Also I couldve done with less about his time in the Army I know it was a hugely important part of his life but it got way too nittygritty for me personallyBut Like I said overall this was very interesting in the most literal and nonnegging sense of the word It kept me engaged except during the military shit and it was very eyeopening about a lot of things The early part especially leading up to and in the aftermath of his mothers death was incredibly moving and made me sad for him and his brother all over again I was 17 when Princess Diana was killed and I remember it vividly I specifically remember the scene Harry describes of him and William walking behind her coffin and thinking that it must have been so incredibly difficult for them to do so in front of millions of people Knowing that they were basically forced into it and also that they werent supposed to show any emotional signs of grief while also being expected to comfort strangers just made the whole thing even more stark I think this is worth the read if you have any interest in the whole situation and for all of his and the books flaws I do still think it was a bold move to put it out there And I just hope he has the sense not to read reviewsShow more

Rating 3 out of 5,"Spare is a story of emotional neglect, immense grief, and the myriad consequences of unaddressed trauma. In therapy, clients are often gently encouraged to consider how making meaning from their traumatic experiences - shaping their own narrative - may unlock aspects of the healing process. Harry utilises this strategy by making his memoir a means of returning to that bereaved little boy - who grew up in an environment where he was not permitted to seek physical affection from adults (hugs were an alien concept), and who knew from an early age that he born for the sole purpose of being the 'spare' - and leading him into the light of present-day freedom.What struck me most while reading Spare was the necessity of dissolving the monarchy, if only for the sake of the children stuck in the spokes of its damaged, merciless wheel. Harry is not the only walking wounded. Other than the tabloid press, I felt William comes across worst, but I would be fascinated to read his own version of events alongside Harry's. William seems to be the typical 'golden child' while Harry is the 'black sheep', a common pattern in families with abusive and unhealthy relationship dynamics. But the golden child suffers too, the fundamental problem being that all the children are raised to believe the love around them is conditional on certain factors. Much of the toxicity and stressful situations involving the Core Four of Harry, Meghan, William, and Kate seem to stem from the immense pressure they were all put under, not only by the tabloid press but by the shifting power dynamics of the Royal Family, with aging figures such as the Queen and Prince Charles essentially out of commission, leaving their advisors (straight out of Downing Street) to pit the younger generation against one another. In this way, Spare reflects the changing times of contemporary British society, its generational and values divide.Harry's fury is directed first and foremost at the British tabloid press - by all accounts with good reason. Is it a coincidence how you can't look at any UK publication without seeing article after article denigrating him for speaking up about his experiences and telling his truth? Ask yourself what they have to lose. Royal Family drama makes them a ton of money, and if people actually started questioning whether it's right to hound human beings like this, whether a celebrity has any right to privacy, whether readers should consider the impact on the subject's mental health, then surely people might start refusing to click these articles and give the media empires more ad revenue? One key takeaway for me is that I will work hard never again to read articles that leap on humanity's lowest instincts and thrive on the misery of other human beings. Even if they're rich. Even if they're famous. Even if they're privileged. It's one thing to see justice done for criminals, another to cackle over who said what to who, and who got upset by it. Harry doesn't shy away from sharing how his wife grew suicidal from the tabloid intrusion, nor how the stress of their constant hounding likely contributed to her miscarriage. Much as he talks about dehumanising his enemies in Afghanistan, he and Meghan Markle became non-persons for the tabloid press - you get the sense they only saw £ signs in front of their eyes whenever there was an opportunity to post anything about Harry or Meghan. It's deeply concerning how Meghan Markle was treated, how Caroline Flack was treated, and how Harry was treated, especially as a child. I found it shocking how much could be legally published with no recourse, and how actually speaking up or suing would make it worse. There's a sense of being manipulated and victimised by a press that is always hungry for more drama. I felt my brain rotting just from reading about it so much. What do the press have to gain from keeping the British public distracted in this way? Surely not how the government is deliberately throwing the country off a cliff? It made me think of Plato's Cave. Step outside the cave and say no to the shadow puppet dance. Murdoch empire string-pullers.I have no reason to believe anything Harry says is untrue, although clearly it's a one-sided account, which is why I would be fascinated to read William's contribution. They seem to see things so vastly differently, and clearly Harry was being left out of a lot of meetings and things were being discussed and decided without him, so I do wonder what was said to William, and what his motivations were. Late in the memoir, it becomes clear that there are a number of key advisers essentially holding the family to ransom based on their own perceptions of what is best. It honestly reminded me of Littlefinger and Varys from Game of Thrones. Growing up in a small, conservative village in England, from my perspective throughout school the Royal Family were these minor gods, removed from the realities of being human, and somehow perfect and unquestionable. But clearly they're all flesh and blood humans, and no one exemplifies this more than Charles, who comes across as deeply damaged by an emotionally abusive childhood and still carrying the scars of being bullied throughout his schooldays. Seemingly so desperate for love and approval that he'd throw his children under the PR bus if it meant more good publicity for him and Camilla. Not that he hates his children (while hugely repressed, he also comes across as loving and at times vulnerable in front of Harry), but he's so deeply lacking in core love and worth that he needs to seek it from the empty press. Fundamentally, what I learnt from Spare is that the whole institution is fucked. It's frightening how emotionally removed the adults are from the children, and I respect Harry and William for clearly wanting to try to parent their children differently. The damage to Charles, Harry, William, is immense. This is a family that encapsulates the concept of generational trauma, and doubtless it goes back to the trauma of World War II, and even further, with generation after generation deeply impacted by upper-class white British repression and stiff upper lip misery. It would be interesting to read Spare after watching The King's Speech.Finally, Harry himself comes across as a bit of a Made in Chelsea stereotype, if I'm being honest. He does make the point that he was infantilised and wanted to work and make his own money, but he was constrained by his father and the palace into a working royal role. It's fascinating how as a grown man he has access to millions of pounds for charitable foundations, but absolutely nothing for furnishing a flat, beyond what his father allows. So there's an incredible section about Meghan buying a sofa on credit, and IKEA lamps in their flat, and him sneaking out to the high street sales every six months or so to buy a few items of clothing. Yet he's also constantly hopping back and forth to Botswana, Australia, South Africa, living a life that's directionless and restrained, yet full of empty privilege, desperate to find some meaning and purpose. There are times where he lacks self-awareness, such as when he compares himself to Siddhartha Gautama (the Buddha); when he calls William and Kate to ask whether a Nazi uniform would be a good choice for a fancy dress party; when he uses a slur against a Pakistani friend etc. He does seem put out at the fact that he would be called racist for saying racist things, or criticised for comparing killing Taliban fighters with video games, when that's what he does. I did find myself getting frustrated by his wide-eyed attitude, since there comes a point where you need to think about what you say, and how it will be taken. Having said that, Harry also explores quite early on how his childhood trauma led to various behavioural changes, memory and processing issues, focus problems, that all point to actual lasting damage and are very real things. He doesn't seem to have had any help with any of this, until seeking out therapy much later in his life. That's a failing on the part of his family, because they didn't protect a vulnerable, bereaved child. Neglect features constantly. I think some make the immediate criticism that he's grown up in castles and palaces and boarding schools, he wanted for nothing, so he shouldn't complain. As Harry describes it, he was limited to his bedroom, the dining room, and the sitting room, and lived a somewhat Spartan existence with limited possessions. What's clear to me is that you could have everything you ever wanted, but if you lack love, and can't have a cuddle, and don't know how to cry, and are dissociating from a young age, and all you get told is to be a man, then you're going to walk away deeply wounded and damaged. Some will scoff, but it's true. We need warmth and love more than we need anything else. Since Harry brings up post-traumatic stress, there's evidence that the difference between soldiers who end up with PTSD and those who don't often comes down to whether they formed strong early attachments, and how well those were sustained into adulthood. Put simply, you can suffer so much and come out basically fine if you know you're loved. If you feel unwanted and unworthy, you could be a Prince of England, yet believe yourself worse than nothing.cw: trauma; emotional neglect; suicidal ideation; bereavement; racism; gaslighting;

Rating 2 out of 5,"There's a famous quote from Oprah Winfrey's interview with Maya Angelou where Dr. Angelou says, ""when people tell you who they are, believe them."" Early on in this book, Prince Harry says he's not much of a reader, hates Shakespeare, barely made it through school (and even considered not training to fly a particular kind of plane because it would require more in-class study), liked Of Mice and Men because it was the easiest book on the syllabus, and didn't even know what Eat, Pray, Love was referring to when Megan Markle made a casual reference to it.So it makes me absolutely insane when I see otherwise sane people cooing over what a sensitive and thoughtful man Harry has grown up into, based on the text. I might be 100% pure peasant by birth and no royal-watcher, but I have ghostwritten texts, and in my humble but (alas) very experienced opinion, there is no way this kid did his own homework. Even the book's defenders have remarked upon its unevenness, veering from bizarre fixation on inconsequential details like Boy Harry's fixation on smooshing together Opal Fruits to eat at school to ornamental, purple prose that doesn't sound like the voice of someone who would rather be watching Friends than listening to Beethoven like his father.Honestly, this is what ghostwriters do. They use artful puffery when the subject isn't giving them much in the way of stuff worthy to be written about. The first part of this book in particular reads like bad A03 fanfiction by an American, gleaned from Googling Wikipedia details about the royal family. Isn't boarding school life awful? Isn't it horrible and cruel to send kids away? Every single selected detail is clearly designed to play to the sensitivities of a middle-class American reader who loved Diana. Every bad choice Harry makes is linked back to the loss of his mother.It reads too like one of those quasi-modern historical romance issues where the reformed bad boy has mommy issues. The thing is, as an American who has lived in the UK--while I do think there's a strong argument it's kind of fucked up to send a kid away at 7 to school--people don't regard it with the horror that the reader of this text is encouraged to feel.Because this is very much a produced text. Like all autobiographies of the Windsors, it's encouraged to play upon the target reader's sympathies in the weird public relations total war that's been waged ever since I can remember.Harry is trying--with the help of Andre Agassi's ghostwriter, one of the best in the business--to paint himself as the progressive royal who doesn't stand on ceremony and defended his wife against racist attacks. The problem is, there's a helluva lot in his history that doesn't jive with this constructed persona he has to explain. He says he dressed as a Nazi because he was invited to a Natives and Colonials fancy dress party (!) and had nothing to wear. Sweetie, you're a member of the royal family, in that instance, it's a ""Come as You Are"" invite. He attended sensitivity classes with a rabbi after there was backlash to a photo of him dressed in a Nazi costume, and in the book says he was shocked to learn about the details of the Holocaust, because, you know, he never really paid attention in school. Come fucking on, if that's true, that's absolutely revolting that you, with your fancy education, couldn't be bothered to pay attention before to a genocide and war that was literally on your own fucking doorstep.He also explains away being caught on tape referring to a Pakistani man by a racial slur because he didn't know it was a slur. Really? I mean, really?He complains the press calls him a druggie, but freely and cheerfully describes very extensive drug use in extensive detail.Some parts of the book are stronger than others. I do find the passages describing his wartime service, his compassion for fellow veterans, and his experiences in Australia riding horses and rustling cattle on the outback to ring true in a way the others do not. It does makes sense that he's the sort of hands-on person who can only be motivated to care about something when he's personally confronted with it. But the book shows a striking lack of empathy to people other than himself. Even his own father--for example, he notes how Charles often had trouble praising him to his face, so he'd write a loving letter to his son instead, to put into words what he couldn't say aloud. I know it's hard, but given Charles's own upbringing, he obviously was trying his best to communicate. Using this to damn his father seems a bit insensitive and cruel.The British tabloid press is disgusting, and by the end of the book, despite all my reservations, I do confess to feeling warmer towards Harry when reading how horrific life can be when people literally make a living acting as vampires, sucking life and money from your every folly and taking photos of you doing the most ordinary things. But that makes Megan's protests that she had no idea what the expectations of her as a royal would be utterly absurd. She claims she NEVER GOOGLED THE FAMILY, and Harry says this multiple times. Again, really? REALLY? This makes her seem either willfully ignorant or a liar.The end of the book also contains lots of petty disputes in excruciating detail between himself and his brother. I suppose when your shopping at Waitrose is national news it's easy to feel as if this is interesting, but it just made me feel sad that the usual type of sibling rivalries and petty wedding shit that goes on in every family was put into a friggin' bestselling book.I read this because of FOMO after seeing so many of my friends reading it and I got it from my library. I feel a little guilty, too, because I know so many of my friends identify with the original image of Megan as an American woman of color who married a royal. And it would have been lovely if the fairytale images had been true, and things had gone well. I also hate the tabloids, so I can understand sympathizing with Harry and Megan because the enemy of my enemy is my friend. But the book just doesn't ring true or sit right with me. I feel manipulated as a reader in a very clumsy way.Then again, Shakespeare's Prince Hal does the same--acts like a drunk asshole for most of the Henry IV plays, pisses off his father, and then refashions himself as a great military authority and populist, using his past image to skillfully make him seem all the more noble.

Rating 3 out of 5,"It was mostly boring and very much self-absorbed, but what can you expect of an autobiography (by a 38-year-old man.) The main issue that really disgusted me was how much he went on and on about the dehumanization he suffered from the press, treating him (and sometimes his family) like royals are clowns for public entertainment and not people, which seems like a true claim—but at the same time, he does the exact same things to specific journalists and courtiers (for example, the couple of journalists Tweedle Dumb and Tweedle Dumber). In many other cases, he calls them villains, tormentors, and so on. I do understand the difficulty of living like that from childhood onwards, and the relationship between the public and the royals (channeled by the press) is indeed complicated and unhealthy. But this just shows how little does he really understand—or care—about the people he is supposed to ""work for"" as a royal. The same people who pay for his various palace homes, his parties, and his so very treasured security. It's fine if you don't want to do this work, and pay the costs (""The question of how to pay for a home and security kept Meg and me awake at nights""—get a job maybe? Don't live in a billion-dollar estate?)

We are taken through his school years to his time that he served in the British Army then on through the years beyond to the present. I thought his writing was very good but his use of the F four lettered word made its way into this book often. The story dragged somewhat in his school years and for a small percentage of my reading time I felt bored by the parties and lifestyle he lived but for the most part of the book I enjoyed reading it and felt that I got to understand Harry better . His mother dying so suddenly and tragically because of the media chasing her car left Harry , at a tender age, unable to except her death. This book centers on how he came to except his mother’s death and how he and anyone he knows personally are harassed by the media. I believe that Prince Harry was honest and truthful in this memoir of his life and about his relationship with his family. I’m glad that I read this book because it answered a lot of questions I had about why he and Meghan left England. I usually read Fiction and Biographies and Memoirs aren’t my genre . I wanted to read this book because of my curiosity with the royal family. Those negative post on Facebook that the Peps post sound like elementary school children tattling on one another and idle gossip . I couldn’t put this book down for most of the time I spent reading it. I purchased my own copy of this book.

Rating 2 out of 5,"As anticipated: trashy, mawkish, saccharine, tone deaf, cliched, bizarre, and occasionally sympathetic. Best bits:- Harry likening himself and William to Lennie and George from ‘Of Mice and Men’ (a stretch?) - Harry’s tales from boarding school, a la Enid Blyton - The Queen pretending to rock out to Brian May while wearing tiny yellow noise-cancelling earplugs - The great saga that is Harry’s frost-bitten penis, which blessed the world with the following sentence: “between these thoughts of Mummy and death and my frostnipped penis…Worst bits: - Teenaged Harry having his head shoved inside a bleeding deer carcass. Even the most vehement proponents of hyper-masculinity have got to admit that this is taking the whole thing a bit far? - Harry gloating about killing members of the Taliban. Don’t get me wrong, I’m no Taliban fan, but 200 pages of ‘I’m the man because I’ve shot people’ did not endear me to the Prince. - Harry and William … fighting over Africa? Strong undertones of the ‘Scramble for Africa’ here, which Harry - aggrieved largely because his brother has stolen his novel and world-class philanthropic ideas - appears to miss entirely. - Harry expressing ardent support for the monarchy? Seems like a bit of a non-sequitur after 500 pages of highly sentimentalised description of the pure hell it put you through …. - The sheer number of nicknames in this thing. No one has a penchant for nicknames like Harry does. First-love Chelsy becomes Chels almost two seconds after she has been introduced. Meghan becomes ‘Meg’ and then ‘M’ after a single week of African bush-camping. Poor Cressida Bonas lands the unfortunately wilted moniker ‘Cress’. Can no one keep their full name in this text?! Harry himself has about ten nicknames, ranging from H to Spike to Bazza.

Rating 1 out of 5,"Okay, so I just finished listening to ""Spare"" by Prince Harry, and I gotta say, it was a snooze fest. The only thing that kept me going was the hope that he would spill some serious tea about the royal family or at least give us some juicy details about his life with Meghan. But nope, nada, zilch.Harry's tone throughout the book was so whiny, it was like listening to a kid who didn't get his way. And let's be real, the book was just a ploy to make some money and play the victim card. I mean, come on Harry, we get it, the press was a bitch to you and Meghan. But guess what? You're not the only ones who have dealt with the paparazzi.And speaking of Meghan, I was hoping for some insight into their relationship or at least some anecdotes about their life together. But nope, we got nothing.At the end of the day, I was left wondering why Harry even bothered writing this book. It was like he was trying to prove something to someone, but I'm not sure who. And apparently, he's already working on another book? Like, what could he possibly have left to say? The only thing that would be remotely interesting at this point is if he spills the beans on who allegedly made the comment about their child's skin color.Overall, ""Spare"" was a disappointment. Harry needs to step up his game if he wants to keep us interested. Oh, yeah!

Rating 5 out of 5,"My main takeaways from this book: 1.) The true villain of Harry's story is the British press. For most of his life, they have spun and leaked stories about him, and up until now, he was never allowed to say anything to defend himself. 2.) How much the military shaped Harry. He truly found his calling as an active member of the military, and it gave him a sense of purpose for the first time in his life. 3.) The hurt towards his family isn't necessarily directed at them as individuals, but rather the way in which they have played into the bizarre world of the British press, including the deliberate leaking and planting of stories. Also, the hurt at them not standing up for him or his family. He has been the distraction and scapegoat for far too long. 4.) His mother's traumatic death impacted him in a way we will never fully understand. Refusing to believe she was gone, he convinced himself that she was in hiding, making a new life, and would one day come get him and William. He internalized the pain in a way he wasn't even fully aware of, because he didn't have the coping skills at 12 years old. 5.) His complicated relationship with the press began long before his relationship with Meghan. However, it escalated to a whole new level because Meghan was biracial with a black mother. The death threats, vile slurs, blatantly racist comments were truly unlike anything he had ever seen. How could he not be afraid that history would repeat himself? I'm so glad he and Meghan are creating a new life for themselves and their family here in America. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/5 stars!Show more",5,My main takeaways from this book 1 The true villain of Harrys story is the British press For most of his life they have spun and leaked stories about him and up until now he was never allowed to say anything to defend himself 2 How much the military shaped Harry He truly found his calling as an active member of the military and it gave him a sense of purpose for the first time in his life 3 The hurt towards his family isnt necessarily directed at them as individuals but rather the way in which they have played into the bizarre world of the British press including the deliberate leaking and planting of stories Also the hurt at them not standing up for him or his family He has been the distraction and scapegoat for far too long 4 His mothers traumatic death impacted him in a way we will never fully understand Refusing to believe she was gone he convinced himself that she was in hiding making a new life and would one day come get him and William He internalized the pain in a way he wasnt even fully aware of because he didnt have the coping skills at 12 years old 5 His complicated relationship with the press began long before his relationship with Meghan However it escalated to a whole new level because Meghan was biracial with a black mother The death threats vile slurs blatantly racist comments were truly unlike anything he had ever seen How could he not be afraid that history would repeat himself Im so glad he and Meghan are creating a new life for themselves and their family here in America 5 starsShow more
Rating 3 out of 5,"What a strange, unhappy book this is: full of self-pity, lacking in self-awareness. Interest ebbs and flows, the collision between a man and his ghostwriter frequently more interesting than the events they are describing.And yet the tragedy at the book’s centre: that of a boy losing his mum, and simply being unable to deal with it, as his life is disfigured by tradition and a deeply unwell media, is genuinely upsetting, and a story eminently worth telling. The way that the death cast a shadow over his life, becoming its defining incident, will be relatable for anyone who lost a mother young – especially if it happened suddenly – and his terror that the same fate might befall his wife feels, if not necessarily accurate, at least utterly sincere and entirely understandable.Those elements, despite some swerves into phony mysticism, are resonant and moving, and the sneering at them from some quarters has been sociopathic. If you didn’t lose your mum when you were young, you simply don’t know what it is like. I never thought I’d have anything in common with this posh, formerly lairy patriot, and yet here we are.Harry’s right too that the British media is rotten, and that its treatment of his wife was deeply racist. He has been vilified chiefly because he dared to question two all-powerful institutions – Fleet Street and the royal family – and because he married a mixed-race woman.But that doesn’t mean the book is very good. One problem with Spare is that his obsessive hatred of the press, every bit as virulent as their dislike of him, is ultimately quite boring. He regards every wrong detail in every story as equally problematic (and lists them all), while seeing every indictment of him as equally heinous, even when he was caught dressing up as a Nazi. He also writes in such cartoonish and repetitive terms (frequently resorting to painfully unfunny nicknames) that the result is ultimately rather deadening. It’s clear that much of this was hell to live through, and that the relentlessness he documents was a key part of the problem – the inevitability of attack forever hanging over him, manufacturing a pervasive anxiety – but it is also tedious to read about, especially with this absence of nuance.That treatment of the media – in which every error or intrusion is the same as every other – reflects a wider problem with the book. There is simply no hierarchy of information here, just an endless stream of stories, some of them touching, some of them fascinatingly candid (ever wanted to know what Prince Charles smells like? Step right up), and many of them remarkably dull. As such, it makes for a surreal read. At one point Harry is teaching the Queen Mum to do an impression of Ali G, an anecdote that segues straight into 9/11. Then Prince Charles turns up at a school play, laughs at all the wrong parts, and has his confusing behaviour attributed to the acting out of past trauma. Like, what the fuck.The ghostwriter has clearly been tasked with maintaining a coherent through-line, and keeps dragging everything back to the central concept of the ‘spare’ and to totemic moments in his subject’s life (walking behind his mother’s coffin, calling in support during a mission in Afghanistan, etc) in order to pin together these often disparate anecdotes, many of which are for some reason about the author's penis. The prose style of the book is just amazingly distracting, as you try to figure out which bits are actually Harry, and which are being spun into prospective PR gold by his literate associate. You can practically see the research sessions, and understand how the book was put together, as you read it. Harry seems like a fairly nice lad, one of the few members of his family who has actually engaged with the changes in society over the past quarter-century, and permitted himself to have his mind changed. But he never comes across as being enormously bright, and at times the gulf between the man and the book he has supposedly written becomes rather too broad: while some of the therapy speak may be his, an erudite rumination on the nature of numerous selves is immediately followed by him saying that he had to google the word ‘compère’. He does cheerily acknowledge that the quote from Faulkner which opens the book was sourced not from Requiem for a Nun but from BrainyQuote.com.The other issue with Spare – and yes, I’m afraid we are now getting to the Marxist reading ��� is the author’s complete obliviousness to his economic privilege. He (or his ghost) haplessly tries to position him as some sort of poor relation, who doesn’t fit in at prep school among the posh boys, has a mortgage on a steeply discounted house, and can only afford IKEA furniture compared to his big brother’s genuine stuff. This is slightly undercut by the fact that he is Prince fucking Harry, a literal prince who is frequently being given large homes, enjoying a spot of shooting, or just popping over to Botswana again to recharge. As a narrator, he is a man with absolutely no concept of financial hardship or what it might entail or lead to. You can be wealthy and still have a deeply difficult life – in a lot of ways, I think Harry has; but he strikes the wrong note here time and again, and his attempts to mitigate the issue with unconvincing token qualifications only make it worse. That lack of self-awareness, coupled to a rather noisy self-pity, can take the book dangerously close to Ashley Cole’s notorious autobiography, in which he author has to pull his car over to the side of the road because Arsenal have only offered him £60,000 a week.By the end of the book, Harry is enthusiastically describing his family as a “death cult” (come on, man, get off the fence), but it’s the throwaway details – not the hyperbole – that leave the greatest impression. Namely that they never, ever hug each other. William doesn’t come out of the book as badly as its author probably imagines; they both just seem quite unhappy, damaged by their weird lives. Also if Prince William tore my necklace and pushed me over, you would have to torture me before I told anyone.Surely the book’s most disquieting element, though, is that, in the acknowledgements, Harry thanks James Corden. What a twist. You think all along that he's the hero, the wronged party. And then when the book is literally over, it turns out he's friends with James Corden. Real Keyser Soze stuff.I read Spare out of voyeurism, thinking it would be fun to take the piss out of it. And it was. But ultimately I found Harry’s relationship with his mum, and with her memory, relatable and haunting and sad. Though the book is something of a mess, and a heavily-ghosted one at that, it’s impossible (unless you’re some sort of twat) to begrudge the 12-year-old walking behind that coffin some measure of peace.Show more",3,What a strange unhappy book this is full of selfpity lacking in selfawareness Interest ebbs and flows the collision between a man and his ghostwriter frequently more interesting

Rating 5 out of 5,"This book was everything I’d hoped it would be and more. It brought tears to my eyes more than once. I’m baffled by anyone who has trouble understanding Harry’s position. He’s been nothing but reasonable, rational, open and thoughtful in his desire to create a safe space for himself and his wife and children. He has been willing to admit his mistakes, regrets, privilege and biases. This isn’t a salacious tell-all. What he offers here is a scathing and relentless censure of the press, but also a very gentle pulling back of the curtain on a privileged institution that has benefited from its unquestioned authority for centuries. Whenever a group of people consider themselves above reproach, above questioning, bad things happen. Transparency is vital. When lights are turned on, roaches scatter. And Harry is turning the lights on. ‘Spare’ corroborates a lot of feelings and theories I’ve had about the British Royal Family for a long time. Harry fills in specifics and elaborates with details and personal anecdotes, but overall I can’t say I’m particularly surprised by his revelations. Disappointed, yes. Shocked? No. It’s so sad to have proof that this family’s top priorities lay in their relationship with the British press and managing their public image. (Which they have proven time and time again to be absolutely horrendous at so why do they keep on with this nonsense??) The fact that they as a whole, as an institution, place more importance on propping up said institution than their relationships with their own family members is just so sad. Not surprising, not news, but getting actual specific examples of them doing so is so disappointing. (Excellent image management, guys! 👍🏼)I knew the “Firm” had repeatedly ignored Diana’s needs and requests in the past (not to mention all the benefits and excellent PR she initially brought to the family) but to see them continuing this behavior into the next generation and beyond… it’s mind blowing. (To befriend an editor who previously attempted to blackmail your son just to maintain the quid pro quo for your own sake is reprehensible. I knew Charles was a shithead but DAYUM. That’s cold.)So I knew things were bad, I just didn’t know they were THIS bad. That certain members of the Family were THIS oblivious. THIS ignorant. THIS self-serving. I remember when Diana died. And I remember when Charles & Camilla married. I also remember wondering how, in just a few short years, public opinion could go from Camilla the Homewrecker/Charles the Cheater to Hurray For The Happy Newlyweds. And now they are embraced by the country as King and Queen. Are our memories so short? Maybe yes, maybe no. But I think Harry reveals an important piece of the puzzle here and that is just how much the British press controls public “opinion,” and how much the British press (or a portion if it) is controlled by the monarchy. It all feels very Fox News. The press say something and it instantly becomes “fact.” They suggest something and it instantly becomes “public opinion,” regardless of how the public actually feels. If they say that’s how the public feels, then that’s How They Feel™️. Bullshit has become Fact. I’m proud of Harry. I’m glad he left the institution that’s continually caused him pain and ignored his grief. I’m glad he’s telling the people who told him “we’ve all gone through this, you’re not special, suck it up” that maybe now is a good time for it to stop - for everyone. No one else needs to suffer. I’m also glad he has made public things his mother never could (and in ways she never could) and finally found some measure of peace with his own little family. Good for him. And I think he’s displaying quite a lot of grace by still being open to reconciling with his father and brother. Whether they’re able to reconcile or not, I hope he’s able to maintain his serenity and fulfillment.

Rating 3 out of 5,"If you have seen the Netflix documentary, this book really doesn't give you a whole lot more . . .at least not in regard to Meghan and the strife with the press. There is quite a bit about Harry's military service, and some about his childhood and his young adult carousing, but everything seems oddly lacking in specific detail. The book never comes to life like the best memoirs do.On the flip side, if you haven't seen the documentary, you might enjoy this insider perspective of the monarchy. At times, I felt empathy for Harry. Like, imagine raising a little lap dog in your house and feeding it the best tidbits and giving it a nice bed and caring for it every day, and then, one day, when it stops following your obedience commands as it once did, you let it out into the woods to fend for itself. That's really not going to go well is it? Harry was raised for a specific kind of life, but the mental stress of the media was relentless.Ironically, his father told him over and over not to read the media. And he didn't take that advice until after he moved to the United States. I think it was good advice. I don't see how someone could live in peace with all these stories circulating about your family.It's hard to be born into one kind of life and yearn for another. In some cases, the yearning can lead to the life one desires. But in this particular case, I can see why it was nearly impossible to pursue one's own path. There is a sadness to that even though it feels a little overshadowed by some of the material concerns. Poor little rich boy. It's hard to garner sympathy for the most privileged, but at the same time, self actualization is what we all strive for, and it's constantly out of Harry's grasp.The format of this book is very readable.

I'd like to preface this review by saying that I'm Spanish, I live in a country with a monarchy that has had numerous scandals and I dislike several of them, I’m not a monarchist or royalist. That being said, I’m reviewing this book commenting on Harry’s life, not the British monarchy.
After finishing this book, I came to the realization that everyone was exaggerating with this ""exposé"" book. He didn’t reveal anything that would take down the British monarchy or initiate an inquisition against the people mentioned in this memoir.Harry is an overly privilege man, despite travelling and experiencing many different cultures and social stratification, he did so with the awareness that he was a member of the Windsor family. It’s difficult to be open minded and think outside your bell jar if that’s all you’ve ever known. Blaming other people for what occurred in Vegas, or for wearing a Nazi costume as well as using racial slurs... I would have preferred if he had admitted what he did without making excuses.So my take on all of this is that no matter how many one-star reviews you leave, the British monarchy will continue to be rich in their palaces, and Harry and Meghan will also continue sipping wine in their Santa Barbara mansion.Show more",4,"Id like to preface this review by saying that Im Spanish I live in a country with a monarchy that has had numerous scandals and I dislike several of them Im not a monarchist or royalist That being said Im reviewing this book commenting on Harrys life not the British monarchy

Rating 2 out of 5,"As someone who isn't a Royalist or familiar with the British Royal family, I decided to read Prince Harry's memoir when I saw it at my local library. The book is divided into three parts, covering his younger years (with a focus on his mother), his time in the military, and his more recent life with Meghan.Unfortunately, I found the book uninteresting and struggled to keep reading. I only made it to 47% (part two) before skipping ahead to part three for more information on his current life.

Rating 5 out of 5,"Prince Harry recounts his life experiences as the Duke of Sussex.As soon as I heard about this book, I knew that audiobook was the only way to go and boy was I right! I loved listening to Prince Harry narrate his own story. He is so tender and kind hearted and often sounded like a lost, hurt boy still mourning his beloved mother, Princess Diana. His pain and grief were palpable, and I have so much sympathy for his plight. Also, I could hear it in his voice when he was amused or delighted.After struggling to find his place in the world, he found it in both South Africa and conservation and the military. After a brutal boot camp experience including trench foot, all Harry wanted to do was serve his country in Iraq, but that was cut short after threats to his life by snipers etc after his location was revealed by the media. Instead, he was sent to Afghanistan because ironically, it was deemed ""safer."" Within the Army environment, he finally found something he was good at, something that made him happy.By the time he met Meghan, he'd dealt with so many lies, mistruths, pressures, and bullying due to the media (not only to himself, but to his family, friends, fellow comrades in arms, and innocent bystanders), it's no wonder he reacted in panic when his wife received threats. He had every right to be terrified that the media might also cause her life to end in tragedy just like his mom's. For those judging him for doing a tell all, don't forget that both of his parents did the same: Prince Charles confessing to adultery with Camilla and Princess Diana about her marriage to Charles. Before this book was released, it received so many unfair 1 star ratings out of spite and debuted at 2.96. I'm so happy that, at the time of me writing this review, it's at 4.14. Overall, I found this memoir heartbreaking, touching, funny, romantic, and raw. It brought both tears of joy and sadness, and I'm glad I listened to his side of the story.

Rating 1 out of 5,"zero stars and a million thumbs downharry is a delusional man child who has been neglected and rejected all his life by his weird fucked up family, and that makes me feel sorry for him. he's also never read a book in his life or spared a single thought for anyone other than himself and his immediate family and circle of friends. There's 87 chapters in this book and at no point in any of those chapters is there even a crumb of an observation about what living conditions are like in Britain or the rest of the world for non-royal human beings. he treats the continent of Africa like his own personal theme-park-cum-philanthropic-fixer-upper, a place he can jet off to every now and then when his dad or brother or the British press are being particularly cunty to him and harshing his vibes.he killed 25 people in Afghanistan and has no problems with putting that in writing for the world to see (absolutely insane that no one around him tried to stop him from putting this detail in the book - JR Moehringer, get your coin I guess....?) Harry insists the 25 were Taliban operatives (i.e. illiterate farmers, probably) and therefore killing them was chill. Throughout the book he is unswerving in his belief that the war in Afghanistan was just and his only regret is that western forces did not do enough to capture the hearts and minds of the Afghan people. I guess it was probably hard to find the time in between coordinating hospital airstrikes, massacring unarmed civilians and administering prisoner torture camps???? The parts of this book not spent reminiscing over his fond memories of blowing up brown people in the desert are dedicated to convincing us that he is just like your average punter innit, who enjoys watching the tv show Friends and jerking off his totally functional not frost bitten penis with elizabeth arden 8 hour cream (which mummy used to put on her lips!!) I am also 100% certain after reading this book that if he had the power, he would round up all journalists (not just the tabloid ones) and send them to concentration camps for killing mummy and corrupting daddy. His hatred of journalism is probably the closest thing he has to a guiding purpose or principle in life. Just normal guy things!!all of this is to say, i think we should criminalise the use of the expression 'speak my truth' immediately and put this man in jail for war crimes ***I think also it’s worth noting I went into the audiobook with a relatively open mind and some empathy for him and his situation, but after finishing his memoir I can say UNEQUIVOCALLY that this man has the most rancid vibes on the planet.

""You're living the life she couldn't. You're living the life she wanted for you.""
 This one hurt. I have never cared for the royals. But the women in my family have always had a deep connection with Princess Diana. My mom loved her so much that she named my little sister after her. So naturally, I've adored her my whole life. After watching the Crown I got more invested, and after watching the racist attacks on Meghan from the British press- I have grown to DESPISE the royal family. This book only made that hate grow, quite frankly. 
So my overall thoughts:
• Harry's grief was painful to read about. If you've lost someone you loved, you will fully understand him. Especially when it was the one person who truly saw & protected you. It's clear his family failed him.• Meghan has been and continues to be unfairly attacked by the British press. Their alliance with the monarchy is disgusting and I know William/Kate/Charles/Camilla will get the karma they deserve. • I'm happy for Meghan and Harry. They have a wonderful life in a lot of ways. Their home is beautiful, they clearly have great people around them and they are doing amazing work. But I'm frustrated that they can never fully be at peace because the press is so unhinged.  This quote really hurt me the most: 
I asked why he was doing this.My mother.Your...?My mother loved your mother.
For context on the quote: Tyler Perry gave M & H his home to stay in during the lockdown because his father pulled all security from their previous home. Harry asked him why he would do all this for them, and Tyler tells him that it was because his mother loved Diana. Tyler's own mother had passed a few years ago and was still dealing with his own grief. Show more",5,"Youre living the life she couldnt Youre living the life she wanted for you

Rating 4 out of 5,"It's hard to rate this one because while I found Spare fascinating at times, and the ghostwriter did a gorgeous job with the writing, I felt there lacked some introspection at the end that would have brought a level of depth and clarity that it lacked. I've read a few books about the royal family before, but I was glad to hear an eyewitness account to stories I had read in the past. Harry is vulnerable and open in this account of his life so far. The way he described his denial of his mother's death for so long and how he still hurts deeply even today brought a few tears to my eyes. I loved reading about his school days and about his courtship and marriage to Meghan. The middle part dragged a bit for me when Harry's spends quite a bit of time on his army career, but that's just because military discussions don't interest me. I think that if Harry would have waited at least 5-8 more years, he would have had a more nuanced and objective outlook on the entire situation. He barely took any personal responsibility for the way things ended. I don't doubt that his family did some pretty messed up things to him and Meghan, but I can't believe that he didn't have a little more to do with the split than he's admitted. If you like reading about royalty, about celebrities or about people's lives who are vastly different from your own, I think you'd enjoy reading Prince Harry's story.

Rating 3 out of 5,"I basically agreed with the Who Weekly? episode about this memoir--it's startling how un-curious Harry seems to be about most things in the world, and the military section of the book was really boring. But I kind of give Harry (and his ghostwriter) credit for the honesty here--like I know a lot of jokes have been made about Harry citing BrainyQuote.com but I'm kind of like, ""Good for him for just saying 'I read this quote on BrainyQuote.com' instead of pretending like he read it in a book."" But also, Haz, maybe read a book??? Like one?? lolMy favorite anecdote in here that I haven't already seen called out in the press was about a time when he was at a party at Courteney Cox's house and saw Will Arnett, and asked his friend where he recognized Will Arnett from, and the friend was like, ""Batman"" and Harry was like ""Huh?? OH...LEGO BATMAN"" and then he went to Will Arnett and was like ""DO THE VOICE"" and Will Arnett was like ""what"" and Harry was like ""THE BATMAN VOICE"" and then Will Arnett did the Batman voice, and then Harry was like ""YAY AGAIN!"" and then Will Arnett did the Batman voice again and then gave Harry shroomsANYWAY I read this mostly out of curiosity and like, I do think it's pretty clear that the Royal Family has been racist and shitty and also that paparazzi are a nightmare, and good for Harry and Meghan getting out.

The book feels like a desperate attack towards an ex that is not picking up their phone, personal dossier of an Oedipus complex patient and what a drunkard would say to himself in the mirror to prove that he doesn't have a problem.This book is a waste of time.

Rating 3 out of 5,"BRB; typing out a review that’ll be far longer than it needs to be 🫥---I came for thé tea and I almost left cause of the military. Yes this review is long, but you know what, so is this book. I’m not mad I read this, but I don’t think anyone else needs to. If you’re still curious, just do parts 1 & 3, or better yet listen to Celebrity Memoir Book Club’s episode on this book. Those girlies do an amazing job summarizing and hit many of the points that stuck out to me plus extra bits that I didn’t include cause- well I’m just here for fun. 95% of what they said aligns with my thoughts and they say it better than I ever could. Plus, while a lot of the dramatics have been printed in articles, a lot of what I’m seeing after reading the actual book is out of context or misrepresented so if you’re looking for a more accurate recap and great discourse, listen to CMBC’s episode. This review is really just me listing timestamps in the episode and telling you to go listen to it. I stand by what I said about this reading like a teenager's diary but really, were we expecting a brilliant work of literature or intelligent social commentary? I think we got the best possible version that could be had. Again, 45:17-46:49 in CMBC’s ep says it best. I listened to the audiobook which imo is the best way to enjoy this even though I still think his reading was not good. The delivery made me think of someone reading a script poorly but thinking “yeah, I did that”. It gave Debby Ryan wanting to make history. Okay, first things first; the entirety of part 2 plus other bits are a military memoir which for various reasons, I’m not here for. As Ms.uncarley says in her Youtube recap, “If you’re into the military like most fathers are, you’ll eat this shit up. You’ll be like a piggy brought to the mother fucking trough.” And you know what? She’s correct. I’m only going to say one thing about this section. I find this man’s insistence on wanting to repeatedly enter active war zones (after he previously had to be extracted when there were clear attacks led to get to him/kill him) wildly irresponsible. It likely put many lives in danger and cost so much money. I’m not going to break this part down better than CMBC did so, onto the rest. The main reason I read this was for the chaotic bits so here they are: • Harry only refers to his mom Mummy and his brother Willy. • Charles’ voice in the book only addresses Harry as “Darling Boy”.• This boarding school Harry went to as a kid where all these boys just got bathed by women until they were nearly 13- like what?• Harry outs Charles for having a tattered emotional support teddy bear.• William told Harry to pretend he didn’t know him at Eton, hilarious but tbh this just seems like normal sibling stuff. • I strongly believe William balding is karmic relief for him laughing at Harry's shaved head in high school.• Basically, Harry was really emo in high school so he smoked a lot of weed and cigarettes. He also gets high and thinks a fox is talking to him. • Literally don’t read this part if you don’t like bad things happening to animals or gore.  I said I wasn’t going to talk about the deer bit 'cause it’s a lot but no one else seems to have addressed it so now I have to. Harry was taught to hunt and when he killed a deer for the first time, the guy teaching him walks him over to the animal, cuts it open, and shoves Harry’s whole head in there. I just needed someone else to be aware.• He lost his virginity when he was 17 to a much older woman, “She liked horses quite a lot, and treated me not unlike a young stallion. Quick ride after which she’d smack my rump and sent me off to graze.” There's context for this and CMBC addresses it at 38:19-39:25. • Harry addresses his racist/ignorant moments but only to say he was unaware or didn’t know better which like…come on I know a lot of dumb shit happened in 2005 but even then you should have known dressing as Hitler wasn’t great. Like what, did they skip the holocaust at your really expensive boarding school? Later, and unrelated he adds ""To be called lazy? I shuddered. I never wanted to see that word attached to my name. The press had called me stupid for most of my life, and naughty, and racist, but if they dared to call me lazy..."". Anyhow. • William never told Harry he was getting married and he had to find out through the press? Tea. • He does in fact confirm he's been circumcised in Chapter 42 and shortly after talks about his ""todger"" so much. This man wrote about rubbing Elizabeth Arden cream on his frost-bit penis while thinking about his mother. • Harry got high on shrooms at Courteney Cox's house and the moon told him something special was coming (aka Meghan). Also, Harry brings up a few times how he spent a lot of time watching Friends, probably so that it could be a callback for this moment, but he thinks he’s a Chandler (obvi a Rachel) and refers to Courteney as Monica repeatedly at this party and debates telling her that he’s a Chandler which is just annoying. • Harry got high and drunk after his first date with Meghan and watched Inside Out. Honestly good for him. • I feel like at this point we all know Camilla turned Harry’s bedroom into her dressing room and yes it’s peak evil stepmom shit however y’all gotta know, people keep saying palace and while Clarence House is big, I wouldn’t call it a palace. Context y’all. • Harry and Meghan didn't tell each other they loved each other until she quit her job and moved to the UK? Alright. • Meghan makes Harry go to therapy after he has an outburst at her. William later says he thinks Harry's being brainwashed in therapy.• There's all the Kate and Meghan drama; the lipgloss, the baby brain comment. I have nothing to add to this, it was weird, it happened. We can point to cultural differences but I feel like tone and phrasing could have swung fault either way. • Baby Archie broke a Christmas ornament with the Queen's face on it which is camp. • Harry goes to a psychic or a medium to talk about his Mom to which I'm like, is the therapy not doing it for you? Ugh there's just so much. Like that's not even all of it, that's just what I could catch. My main takeaway was wow this is what a broken, dysfunctional family at the centre of a very public workplace looks like. This institution, mainly run by dozens of faceless aids, care about preserving an image and traditions rather than recognizing there are real people at the centre of this. They will likely never acknowledge there needing to be change to reflect our present day. It seems like Harry didn't fully grasp and is still in denial that his family never had and never would have the traditional family dynamic. Like your grandmother stopped hugging your father at something like the age of five, you're offended your brother, the future king of England, was taken aback cause your girlfriend hugged him the first time they met? William was an older sibling put on an entitled yet strict and controlling pedestal and that clearly affected his and Harry’s relationship. Shout out to uncarly again, she very accurately says William “comes off….like a petulant little bitch boy child."" William probably faced a lot of pressure to stick to the status quo and was annoyed that his brother didn’t and there weren’t really any repercussions. A lot of people hate Harry and Meghan for various reasons and look I don't love these people, but I also cannot comprehend why they've been vilified. Please see CMBC 1:45:02 - 1:47:43 cause again they said it best. It's tough cause on the one hand it seems Harry just didn't know how to pick his battles. He lashed out at every headline when many were just par for the course. Like of course the press is going to talk about Meghan having ""goth"" nail polish when her nails were painted black, what else do you expect them to go on about? You have benefited from a life of privilege and are a public figure, which comes with public interest and yeah it sucks but you have to play nice with the press to get good reporting. On the other hand, clearly he will forever be grappling with the loss of his mother and her treatment in the media because of his father’s lack of care and bad parenting (Harry was in denial for a long time that his mom was actually dead and thought she made it up to go into hiding, he begged to see the pictures of his mom from when she died, asked a driver to drive him through the tunnel his mom died in at the exact speed her car was driving the night it crashed, etc). So yeah unchecked trauma isn't helpful. I will also say the way Meghan has been treated by the press and, if we believe Harry's account, his family/the institution isn't okay. When you're in the public eye, a spotlight and scrutiny should be expected but this is just extreme. There’s also his father’s fragile ego. There were multiple occasions where Charles and Camilla apparently didn't let Will and Kate have public outings on the same day as them so that they wouldn't be overshadowed. There were instances Harry points to where Will and Harry were cast badly in the media to make their father and Camilla look better. That plus countless aids and family members were colluding with the media, all to further their own interests. I think Harry isn’t the best at taking accountability. He tries to recognise the privilege he comes from but make it clear he's still very relatable but he just isn't. I think this book would have been more impactful if he was able to address that but like I said, I was never expecting this to be a brilliant book. I got what I came for and that’s fine by me.To cap off, here are my fave lines:“au contraire mon ami”“I was a dry who occasionally got wet”“I don’t know why I should have been reluctant to discuss my penis with pa, or all the gentlemen present, my penis was a matter of public record”""I felt like a kitsch version of Johnny Bravo"", and then proceeds to describe something that sounds nothing like Johnny Bravo.""What was the universe out to prove, by taking my penis at the same moment it took my brother?"" ""He often reminded people of Willy, but that was down to his hairline more than his personality""“So she finished her eat pray love thing”Show more",3,BRB typing out a review thatll be far longer than it needs to be I came for thé tea and I almost left cause of the military Yes this review is long but you know what so is this book Im not mad I read this but I dont think anyone else needs to If youre still curious just do parts 1  3 or better yet listen to Celebrity Memoir Book Clubs episode on this book Those girlies do an amazing job summarizing and hit many of the points that stuck out to me plus extra bits that I didnt include cause well Im just here for fun 95 of what they said aligns with my thoughts and they say it better than I ever could Plus while a lot of the dramatics have been printed in articles a lot of what Im seeing after reading the actual book is out of context or misrepresented so if youre looking for a more accurate recap and great discourse listen to CMBCs episode This review is really just me listing timestamps in the episode and telling you to go listen to it I stand by what I said about this reading like a teenagers diary but really were we expecting a brilliant work of literature or intelligent social commentary I think we got the best possible version that could be had Again 45174649 in CMBCs ep says it best I listened to the audiobook which imo is the best way to enjoy this even though I still think his reading was not good The delivery made me think of someone reading a script poorly but thinking yeah I did that It gave Debby Ryan wanting to make history Okay first things first the entirety of part 2 plus other bits are a military memoir which for various reasons Im not here for As Msuncarley says in her Youtube recap If youre into the military like most fathers are youll eat this shit up Youll be like a piggy brought to the mother fucking trough And you know what Shes correct Im only going to say one thing about this section I find this mans insistence on wanting to repeatedly enter active war zones after he previously had to be extracted when there were clear attacks led to get to himkill him wildly irresponsible It likely put many lives in danger and cost so much money Im not going to break this part down better than CMBC did so onto the rest The main reason I read this was for the chaotic bits so here they are  Harry only refers to his mom Mummy and his brother Willy  Charles voice in the book only addresses Harry as Darling Boy This boarding school Harry went to as a kid where all these boys just got bathed by women until they were nearly 13 like what Harry outs Charles for having a tattered emotional support teddy bear William told Harry to pretend he didnt know him at Eton hilarious but tbh this just seems like normal sibling stuff  I strongly believe William balding is karmic relief for him laughing at Harrys shaved head in high school Basically Harry was really emo in high school so he smoked a lot of weed and cigarettes He also gets high and thinks a fox is talking to him  Literally dont read this part if you dont like bad things happening to animals or gore  I said I wasnt going to talk about the deer bit cause its a lot but no one else seems to have addressed it so now I have to Harry was taught to hunt and when he killed a deer for the first time the guy teaching him walks him over to the animal cuts it open and shoves Harrys whole head in there I just needed someone else to be aware He lost his virginity when he was 17 to a much older woman She liked horses quite a lot and treated me not unlike a young stallion Quick ride after which shed smack my rump and sent me off to graze Theres context for this and CMBC addresses it at 38193925  Harry addresses his racistignorant moments but only to say he was unaware or didnt know better which likecome on I know a lot of dumb shit happened in 2005 but even then you should have known dressing as Hitler wasnt great Like what did they skip the holocaust at your really expensive boarding school Later and unrelated he adds To be called lazy I shuddered I never wanted to see that word attached to my name The press had called me stupid for most of my life and naughty and racist but if they dared to call me lazy Anyhow  William never told Harry he was getting married and he had to find out through the press Tea  He does in fact confirm hes been circumcised in Chapter 42 and shortly after talks about his todger so much This man wrote about rubbing Elizabeth Arden cream on his frostbit penis while thinking about his mother  Harry got high on shrooms at Courteney Coxs house and the moon told him something special was coming aka Meghan Also Harry brings up a few times how he spent a lot of time watching Friends probably so that it could be a callback for this moment but he thinks hes a Chandler obvi a Rachel and refers to Courteney as Monica repeatedly at this party and debates telling her that hes a Chandler which is just annoying  Harry got high and drunk after his first date with Meghan and watched Inside Out Honestly good for him  I feel like at this point we all know Camilla turned Harrys bedroom into her dressing room and yes its peak evil stepmom shit however yall gotta know people keep saying palace and while Clarence House is big I wouldnt call it a palace Context yall  Harry and Meghan didnt tell each other they loved each other until she quit her job and moved to the UK Alright  Meghan makes Harry go to therapy after he has an outburst at her William later says he thinks Harrys being brainwashed in therapy Theres all the Kate and Meghan drama the lipgloss the baby brain comment I have nothing to add to this it was weird it happened We can point to cultural differences but I feel like tone and phrasing could have swung fault either way  Baby Archie broke a Christmas ornament with the Queens face on it which is camp  Harry goes to a psychic or a medium to talk about his Mom to which Im like is the therapy not doing it for you Ugh theres just so much Like thats not even all of it thats just what I could catch My main takeaway was wow this is what a broken dysfunctional family at the centre of a very public workplace looks like This institution mainly run by dozens of faceless aids care about preserving an image and traditions rather than recognizing there are real people at the centre of this They will likely never acknowledge there needing to be change to reflect our present day It seems like Harry didnt fully grasp and is still in denial that his family never had and never would have the traditional family dynamic Like your grandmother stopped hugging your father at something like the age of five youre offended your brother the future king of England was taken aback cause your girlfriend hugged him the first time they met William was an older sibling put on an entitled yet strict and controlling pedestal and that clearly affected his and Harrys relationship Shout out to uncarly again she very accurately says William comes offlike a petulant little bitch boy child William probably faced a lot of pressure to stick to the status quo and was annoyed that his brother didnt and there werent really any repercussions A lot of people hate Harry and Meghan for various reasons and look I dont love these people but I also cannot comprehend why theyve been vilified Please see CMBC 14502  14743 cause again they said it best Its tough cause on the one hand it seems Harry just didnt know how to pick his battles He lashed out at every headline when many were just par for the course Like of course the press is going to talk about Meghan having goth nail polish when her nails were painted black what else do you expect them to go on about You have benefited from a life of privilege and are a public figure which comes with public interest and yeah it sucks but you have to play nice with the press to get good reporting On the other hand clearly he will forever be grappling with the loss of his mother and her treatment in the media because of his fathers lack of care and bad parenting Harry was in denial for a long time that his mom was actually dead and thought she made it up to go into hiding he begged to see the pictures of his mom from when she died asked a driver to drive him through the tunnel his mom died in at the exact speed her car was driving the night it crashed etc So yeah unchecked trauma isnt helpful I will also say the way Meghan has been treated by the press and if we believe Harrys account his familythe

Rating 4 out of 5,"Top Takeaways from my full review: https://www.julesbuono.com/review-spa...First, I’d like to note that as an American I can never begin to fully understand the monarchy. I also never served in the military, lost a parent as a child, or experienced fame. These are all substantial life events that I don’t feel qualified to fully critique as a reader, or even as a human discussing pop culture.That being said, my top takeaway is that Spare is, first and foremost, a story of trauma, grief that went untreated for many years, and familial dysfunction that continues to this day.For me, grief felt like the most constant theme, and Princess Diana’s life and death felt like a thread woven through each story told in the memoir. Beyond that, it’s a story of how fame affects childhood trauma and grief, and even beyond that, it’s a story of how royalty affects fame, childhood trauma, and grief.One of the most shocking things I learned in Spare was Prince Harry’s belief that his mother was still alive after her death and would return to him. It was an absolutely heartbreaking view of childhood grief and the lack of proper support he needed to cope with her death. I can’t imagine anyone reading this book and NOT coming away with a deeper understanding of the impact that losing a parent has on a person.And although I’ve heard a lot about Prince Harry’s relationship and marriage to Meghan Markle, there were a few additional stories about her that will stick with me, including more details about their first date than I’d heard before, and the loving reaction she had towards him after the birth of their daughter. The reader also hears about the fight they had that caused him to seek therapy.Indeed, the final major takeaway I had from Spare, is how therapy ultimately forever changed Harry’s relationships with grief, his family, his royal role, and his wife. It seems a family reconciliation is not out of the question, but Prince Harry seems firm on his view of his experiences and how much he’s worked to cope with them and evolve, and that his family should do the same if there is ever to be a reunion of one of the world’s most notorious families.Full review: https://www.julesbuono.com/review-spa...Book club questions: https://www.julesbuono.com/book-club-...Show more",4,Top Takeaways from my full review httpswwwjulesbuonocomreviewspaFirst Id like to note that as an American I can never begin to fully understand the monarchy I also never served in the military lost a parent as a child or experienced fame These are all substantial life events that I dont feel qualified to fully critique as a reader or even as a human discussing pop cultureThat being said my top takeaway is that Spare is first and foremost a story of trauma grief that went untreated for many years and familial dysfunction that continues to this dayFor me grief felt like the most constant theme and Princess Dianas life and death felt like a thread woven through each story told in the memoir Beyond that its a story of how fame affects childhood trauma and grief and even beyond that its a story of how royalty affects fame childhood trauma and griefOne of the most shocking things I learned in Spare was Prince Harrys belief that his mother was still alive after her death and would return to him It was an absolutely heartbreaking view of childhood grief and the lack of proper support he needed to cope with her death I cant imagine anyone reading this book and NOT coming away with a deeper understanding of the impact that losing a parent has on a personAnd although Ive heard a lot about Prince Harrys relationship and marriage to Meghan Markle there were a few additional stories about her that will stick with me including more details about their first date than Id heard before and the loving reaction she had towards him after the birth of their daughter The reader also hears about the fight they had that caused him to seek therapyIndeed the final major takeaway I had from Spare is how therapy ultimately forever changed Harrys relationships with grief his family his royal role and his wife It seems a family reconciliation is not out of the question but Prince Harry seems firm on his view of his experiences and how much hes worked to cope with them and evolve and that his family should do the same if there is ever to be a reunion of one of the worlds most notorious familiesFull review httpswwwjulesbuonocomreviewspaBook club questions httpswwwjulesbuonocombookclubShow more
Rating 4 out of 5,"I am experiencing extreme cognitive dissonance. Bottom line - I hate how we as a public have degenerated into infotainment junkies and have bred the sick stalkers that satisfy our craving for more scandal, more intrusive details, more ""breaking news"". There's a supply because there's demand. Worst of all, as a result we objectify those ""in the news"", we dehumanise them, and we expect them to endure it, because the proverbial public is said to have the right to know, privacy, any sense of proportion, and truth, and personal autonomy, and even human life be damned. It scares me senseless. I also don't believe for a second that ""Spare"" is whole truth and nothing but the truth, no autobiography is, especially if the author confesses at the beginning of the book that he's very bad at remembering dialogues. ""Spare"" is a point of view, fully valid, very raw and emotional, candid and often funny, on occasions unnecessarily revealing, perhaps at times embellished. But I bought the book and thus voted with my wallet that even if I'm no #TeamHarry (and no #TeamWilliam either; I might have been #TeamQueen), I think the way the press treated him and Meghan Markle was disgusting. If they felt they had to leave, then they had to leave. And now tell in their own way why they did.If I judged ""Spare"" as a work of fiction, I'd say I appreciated the immediate and gripping tension that never ceased, the crisp prose, the rich details. I would, however, complain about the frequent melodrama and that the main characters (excluding the mostly nameless press) were too black and white, too hero-villain.

Rating 3 out of 5,"I always find it difficult to rate memoirs because  how do you give a rating to someone's life story?  Not to mention, this book and most celebrity memoirs are ghost written. So sure...you could rate the writing, the length, or even the portrayal of events that have happened, but it's hard to define what else should impact the final star rating...so take mine with a grain of salt.One of the biggest things reading can teach you is empathy. Memoirs are closest thing to being able to ""Freaky Friday"" and switch places with someone to really get into their head. Most people probably picked up this book because they wanted an inside, celebrity tell-all about the royal family and especially gossip regarding his marriage to Meghan Markle and their subsequent departure from the royal family...because that's definitely one of the reasons I picked it up.But for full transparency, Meghan only makes an appearance for less than 1/3 of the book. The book doesn't paint a  Keeping Up With the Kardashians  dramatic scene. Instead, it shares an inside look at Prince Harry's thought process and rationalization as he navigates the privileged bubble he grew up in and wishes to escape. He's made some really thoughtless and ignorant decisions that the press has capitalized and demonized, but he's also been overtly targeted over the other royal family members due to being ""the spare."" The book is divided into three parts that can best be lumped as 1) his childhood / upbringing 2) time in the military 3) meeting meghan + the present. I personally wish the military portion were shortened because it was over 20 chapters of 2 min narration that sometimes felt repetitive, but hey, it's his story. From a reviewer's perspective, I found it to be too long to be 100% engaging, but if you think about it, he hasn't had much of chance to share ""his side of the story"" until recent years so it makes sense why he feels like there's so much more to say now.

Rating 3 out of 5,"This is a tough one. I appreciated his candor and vulnerability. It’s a memoir and obviously from his point of view and his lenses. There were some funny parts, but the overall feeling I got was of sadness. It’s a sad story of a naive, immature man who’s the product of a sheltered and privileged life who is obviously deeply wounded. Prince Harry Is resilient and I give kudos to his courage to share so much and to go against systemic racism but at the end of the day it reads like a therapeutic cathartic exercise. If you are curious, if you have an interest in the British Royal family, I’d say go ahead and read it. It’s not like it’s a badly written book. Otherwise it’s highly skippable.

She I feel like has made him into this whiny brat who only cares about his image and his wife’s image. They repeatedly ask for privacy but then turn around and do interviews and write tell all books.

Rating 2 out of 5,"2.5 Stars. I read this for the tea ofcourse. I have never assumed this very public family spat to be some anti monarchist take down of a colonialist family, unlike many who did. Nobody was surprised when it was revealed that the British Royal Family is racist. Centuries of colonialism, imperialism and oppression, blood and slavery is what their wealth and legacy is built upon. Sure Harry is allowed to tell his story but his woes are a tale as old as age. The poor, neglected second son of the Prince of England, his sibling rivalry with his older brother who is supposed to be the king one day, his wayward cheating father, a mistreated mother who is more of an iconized entity to him and the pop culture than a humane figure and basically a very cold life that is centered around trying to uphold a system, an institution. William is just another side of the same coin. Both him and his brother are bound by the institution to do a job and both of them made their own choices to do so in their own ways. William is willing to uphold the tradition and Harry isn't. Not in the way HE wanted to.And it's also not surprising at all that Charles and Camilla would try to use other family members to reinstate their image in front of the public. Charles would likely have a considerably short rule, the highlight of his royal career being his scandals with wife and mistress. It doesn't help his already divisive reputation that the monarchy is losing its shine more and more with time where in the 21st century they are just a symbol for the decadence of the old regimes (also against the claims of them boosting tourism for UK, they don't actually). And Camilla has always seemed like an archetype to me. Someone who can easily fit the role of the evil other woman and the evil stepmother. Not that I have much sympathies for her, I merely find her to be unremarkable and unsympathetic. Her being singled out as the main ""villain"" in the whole story isn't even surprising. In fact it almost feels anticlimactic. Are we seriously back to Camilla again? I don't understand what kind of reaction Harry expects from the public. He isn't trying to take a stance against a colonialist institution, he is just lamenting not being allowed to take part in the institution the way he wanted. He isn't really a sympathetic figure. He is a jilted figure who has bitterness against the family for not putting him on a pedestal. All of Harry's promises of ""reforming"" the British media are painfully empty when there is not a single reproach from him towards ""The Firm"". You cannot reform such institutions you can only destroy and if you reform then you will just mold them to suit your agendas. Harry's problems with the British media is that it doesn't make him into an icon the way he wants to be made. Needless to say Prince Harry isn't much of a writer. I won't be surprised if there is some ghostwriting involved here. He goes into details of all his youthful dalliances and physical altercations with his brother but is neglectful (purposeful?) in the way he dismisses the racism. He says his family isn't racist but that it's an unconscious bias which is enough to show me that Harry himself isn't well versed with how racism really works because little microaggressions also constitute as racism. Apart from that there isn't much to talk about in this book. I was honestly sniffing for something on the despicable Prince Andrew. The Royal Family went out of their way to shield him (and did nothing to stop the slander against Meghan Markle which is why her and her husband's ire is justified and begs the question about why does this abhorrent family really needs any meaningful support).Overall this book was as memoirs always go for me. I have never been their biggest fan unless they provide insight to extraordinary experiences of an extraordinary human being. The Royal Family simply doesn't have that kind of interest from me.Show more",2,25 Stars I read this for the tea ofcourse I have never assumed this very public family spat to be some anti monarchist take down of a colonialist family unlike many who did Nobody was surprised when it was revealed that the British Royal Family is racist Centuries of colonialism imperialism and oppression blood and slavery is what their wealth and legacy is built upon Sure Harry is allowed to tell his story but his woes are a tale as old as age The poor neglected second son of the Prince of England his sibling rivalry with his older brother who is supposed to be the king one day his wayward cheating father a mistreated mother who is more of an iconized entity to him and the pop culture than a humane figure and basically a very cold life that is centered around trying to uphold a system an institution William is just another side of the same coin Both him and his brother are bound by the institution to do a job and both of them made their own choices to do so in their own ways William is willing to uphold the tradition and Harry isnt Not in the way HE wanted toAnd its also not surprising at all that Charles and Camilla would try to use other family members to reinstate their image in front of the public Charles would likely have a considerably short rule the highlight of his royal career being his scandals with wife and mistress It doesnt help his already divisive reputation that the monarchy is losing its shine more and more with time where in the 21st century they are just a symbol for the decadence of the old regimes also against the claims of them boosting tourism for UK they dont actually And Camilla has always seemed like an archetype to me Someone who can easily fit the role of the evil other woman and the evil stepmother Not that I have much sympathies for her I merely find her to be unremarkable and unsympathetic Her being singled out as the main villain in the whole story isnt even surprising In fact it almost feels anticlimactic Are we seriously back to Camilla again I dont understand what kind of reaction Harry expects from the public He isnt trying to take a stance against a colonialist institution he is just lamenting not being allowed to take part in the institution the way he wanted He isnt really a sympathetic figure He is a jilted figure who has bitterness against the family for not putting him on a pedestal All of Harrys promises of reforming the British media are painfully empty when there is not a single reproach from him towards The Firm You cannot reform such institutions you can only destroy and if you reform then you will just mold them to suit your agendas Harrys problems with the British media is that it doesnt make him into an icon the way he wants to be made Needless to say Prince Harry isnt much of a writer I wont be surprised if there is some ghostwriting involved here He goes into details of all his youthful dalliances and physical altercations with his brother but is neglectful purposeful in the way he dismisses the racism He says his family isnt racist but that its an unconscious bias which is enough to show me that Harry himself isnt well versed with how racism really works because little microaggressions also constitute as racism Apart from that there isnt much to talk about in this book I was honestly sniffing for something on the despicable Prince Andrew The Royal Family went out of their way to shield him and did nothing to stop the slander against Meghan Markle which is why her and her husbands ire is justified and begs the question about why does this abhorrent family really needs any meaningful supportOverall this book was as memoirs always go for me I have never been their biggest fan unless they provide insight to extraordinary experiences of an extraordinary human being The Royal Family simply doesnt have that kind of interest from meShow more
Rating 4 out of 5,"You know that old, worn out sofa of a quote from Anna Karenina? The one you hear actors playing academics or therapists with arm-patches on TV use…you know the one:“All happy families are alike; but every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” There’s some wisdom there, but after sitting in rooms with other folks with complex PTSD (which is almost always triggered in childhood, and then compounded in adulthood—if left untreated), I’ve developed some addendums to it. That is: “All happy families are alike (and those who come from them assume all families are also like that); but every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way (but uses the same tactics, words, and weapons to keep it that way. The difference: the scale, breadth, and power the individual family has).Really doesn’t trip off the tongue. Well, I’m no Tolstoy. But, basically, I’ve heard terrible stories of childhood trauma and abuse from folks from all kinds of backgrounds, but what they all have in common is the culture of abuse. Basically, it’s paint-by-numbers, when it comes to cycles narcissistic family abuse. The only real difference—how much power and influence your family of origin has.I’m convinced this is why folks have gone nuclear over Harry (and Meghan’s) story… well, that and a very healthy dose of racism (or casteism if you’re a Wilkerson fan). There are A LOT of families who are dealing with these issues, but the sheer scale of the Windsor’s reach and influence doesn’t so much as hold up a mirror to our collective familial pain; nope, it’s created an angry, hot beacon for all of us who’ve ever been caught in similar generational cycles of abuse (no matter what caste you belong to). Spare, if approached from that perspective, can’t not attract intense feedback from many ‘unhappy family’ people (especially those who’ve had a black sheep seek help, speak out, and try to escape), but also from those ‘happy family’ people who can’t imagine on any level, why anyone would spill and flee their families of origin. It’s also just a book. Mind you, it’s written by a world class ghostwriter, JR Moehringer. I have not read his own memoir, The Tender Bar, or his previous collaboration with Andre Agassi (mostly because I’m not really a tennis person), but they are supposed to be great. He’s got Harry’s voice down pat, and the prose is top notch. Certain passages have a Vonnegut-like quality, especially those that take place during Harry’s tours. In particular, there’s a passage about firing a massive gun from a tank that is right out of Slaughterhouse Five. And oddly, because who expects touches of Vonnegut from a book about Prince Harry’s life, it’s not the only similarity. Because PTSD has a way of playing with the memory in such a way that moments bleed into one another; nothing is totally certain or linear. This doesn’t mean that folks with PTSD didn’t experience the trauma. In fact this inability to stay completely with one moment, past or present, is a confirmation of the trauma itself. And Vonnegut plays with this fracturing through intergalactic interventions and time travel (because he’s wicked funny that way). Moehringer plays with it in a more subtle way, but it’s there, in every stutter and muffled blank spot in Harry’s memories. It’s damn effective and reflective of my own experiences with CPTSD, trauma, and abuse. So it goes…In short: the behaviour Harry describes, from his brother and the rest of his family—it’s spot on with pretty much every person I’ve encountered in group therapy. The size is bigger; the words and tactics—exactly the same.I’ve done this weird thing: I believe this person (of privilege) who has been stalked his entire natural life by the people who stalked his mother and killed her (and took pictures as she bled out in the car crash they’d caused). I also believe him about his family. Mostly because of their own behaviour—it’s right there in the unhappy family wheelhouse.Are Harry and Meghan faultless, or not annoying, in any sort of way? God, no. But I don’t expect that from folks who are victims dealing with this level of abuse. Demanding perfection from victims of trauma is gross and absurd. No one is perfect, so following that kind of logic, no one has been victimized (which serves abusers in power just fine).If there’s one big takeaway from Spare, it’s this:If your kids experience a life-altering trauma—GET THEM HELP. And get yourself help too. If you don’t, to drag out another oft used dinosaur of a Jungian quote (also delivered by actors playing chess mentors and social workers with no makeup): “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.”Fate, or loyalty, really.It will come out again. You will act it out until the whole unit ceases functioning. People will leave, and you’ll call disloyalty. In actuality, it is the ultimate loyalty: to the child that never received protection or help they needed. It’s freedom; Freedom at the cost of everything that grown child has ever known or valued but freedom still. What I wish for Harry now is to continue processing, raise the funds he needs to keep himself/his children/wife from being stalked and killed, peace, and love. I wish that for all of us who broke from our unhappy families (except for the need for an intense level of security—that’s fairly unique to the Sussex family). He’s in the pilot’s seat now, and by all accounts he has a knack for flying dangerous objects. Also: I’m totally okay if his survival means the monarchy is grandfathered (or grandmothered) the fuck out. I can’t tell you how weird it was to have to swear an oath to Granny (in two languages) when I became a Canadian citizen. The only thing that would’ve been weirder is swearing it to Charles. Either they get rid of it altogether, or just finally admit that England’s kings, especially the Windsors, aren’t as capable or steady as their Queens. Plus: the legacy of blood, imperialism, and colonialism. Just…So it goes… So it goes, I suppose.Post Script: I’m compelled to say, in the year of our lady 2023, no one who is publishing a book/writing/speaking widely should be using the term “confined to a wheelchair” or “wheelchair bound.” This is especially true if you’re a person who works with disabled folks (or a professional writer who has access to the internet). Wheelchairs are mobility aids; they help disabled people live life and have greater access to the world.

Rating 1 out of 5,"Here is the thing about autobiographies; they contain the things the subject wants you to know about them. Not everything about them, not even necessarily the 100% honest truth about them. But the stuff they think you should know about them to get the picture they want to project. And this is exactly why I have no idea what the actual fuck Prince Harry was thinking while writing this.  Some moments, I could really understand him. Seriously. Nobody likes to have their privacy ruined. Being a public figure from birth sounds like a shit deal. It must be awful. Hell, he even had moments when he sounded mature, like when he talked about accepting that his father was happy with Camilla. I applauded him for that. Then he just had these moments when he managed to ruin all my empathy and positive feelings with one astonishingly stupid statement. Don't get me wrong, we are all products of our upbringing and experiences in life, therefore his baseline for what life should be is way different than mine or yours. That's a fact. But there were moments when he genuinely sounded like he had never met a human being before. I'm not even saying average human, as he didn't spend too much time in genuine relationships with average little people, but just... any human, really. What do I mean? His weirdness culminates when it comes to talking about Meghan, his wife. Sure, he loves her, that's wonderful. But at one point he is amazed by her not being bitchy about having to wait 3 hours at an airport to get to the Botswana vacation he got for the two of them. Harry. Friend. If anyone paid for my Botswana vacation.... I could accept some minor inconvenience. Hell, a bunch of us get that when we pay for our own vacation with the money we actually had to earn with hard work. And it's still a privilege that we are able to travel at all.  Privilege. That is a bit of a keyword here. I'm not the type to claim everyone I dislike is privileged and claim that's an evil horrible thing that needs to be taken away. Yet Harry here has a really weird relationship with his own privilege. He calls himself privileged when he is talking about the video where he calls his friend a Paki. Yet he talks about just popping off to Botswana to hang out with his nature documentary maker friends when he feels stressed. You know what I mean? He has this attitude of everything bad in his life being this gigantic unjust crime, but at the same time he takes so much of the amazing experiences and possibilities as just normal. Again, I get it, he grew up with this. But he is writing a book kind of thinking about his own life. WHERE IS YOUR PERSPECTIVE? He even mentions that the military pilot education he got costing millions of pounds. But hey. No biggie, it's his and it makes him feel good. So it's normal. Sometimes he mentions how these things are great, but he never faces the fact that the only reason he can do all this is because of who and what he is. Harry the Prince only gets the awful stuff, none of the perks are because of the same thing.  He's incredibly unrealistic in many other ways as well. The way he talks about his wife is supremely weird. Some people are more mushy when they are in love, but this. THIS. He is just unable to understand that there are people who can dislike Meghan. He claims the British people not liking her is his own country betraying him. He calls her magic. Every single time she is not automatically adored, he claims she is being abused. Meghan acts in a way that is actually rude (like asking for the lipgloss of Kate, whom she barely even knows, YUCK) and he can't help freaking the fuck out about people not tolerating it. Talking about freaking out. There is this one moment while they are dating. They have a misunderstanding. He gets pissed and apparently he says some mean things. In this 500 page book filled with details about his frostbitten penis (yes, really), we don't get explained what this argument was. Okay. But the way he reacts to his own anger is pathetic. He totally crumbles, says it's unacceptable for him to be angry with her and suddenly feels the need to go to therapy. Not when he believed Diana was just hiding until his TWENTIES. Not when he obviously had drinking problems. But when he snapped at perfect MEEEEEG. Not sure how I feel about his conversations with his therapist. He needs help. That's true. But he seems to surround himself with people and things that make him try and get the exact wrong kind of ""help"". Like a man who has a so obviously distorted version of reality... should probably not do psychedelics and listen to ""spirit mediums"" who tell him his dead mother is actually still hanging out with him. Just a thought.  Now about one of the main ideas; Harry wants privacy. Again, understandable. Then he goes and tells us he used up all the laughing gas when Meeeeeg was in labor with their first child. That he is circumcised. Where and how he lost his virginity. Mate, what are you doing? What is even worse, he does the same with other people. Often people he tries to make appear in a bad light. Like fuck off with talking about his dad having been severly bullied as a kid and still having this toy rabbit to comfort him. Fuck off with assuming the complicated and long relationship between Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Margaret (and assuming Elizabeth started every conflict). He shows absolutely ZERO respect for anyone else's right to privacy. What was the goal here? Because it's such a spineless thing to do, acting so petty.  Talking about petty, he is incredibly jealous of his brother. As opposed to him just having so many hardships, the life of Prince William is just enviable in Harry's eyes. His brother has no hardships! Those are reserved for him and him alone.  All in all, I did not develop the fondest feelings for Prince Harry. Yet, I see King Charles as more of a human being now. Which wasn't the goal, but hey. I take what I can get.Show more",1,Here is the thing about autobiographies they contain the things the subject wants you to know about them Not everything about them not even necessarily the 100

Rating 4 out of 5,"Admittedly, I do not have too much knowledge on the royal family beyond the basics. Having spent a lot of time in London, my interest has definitely grown, but it is not something I have spent much time actively researching or reading about. The headlines and news stories that come from them are obviously unavoidable, so I have seen the frenzy around Harry and Meghan but reading this book was the first time I actually took a look at all of this and I thought his perspective was pretty fascinating. My major rule with any memoir is to take everything with a grain of salt. Everyone has their own personal motives for what they want the world to know and what they want to keep a secret which is proof enough in Harry saying this book was originally 800 pages instead of the “condensed” final 410 pages. We will probably never have the full truth about what goes on behind closed doors, ESPECIALLY these closed doors, but it was fascinating to get a sneak peek. There are uncomfortable moments to this book, and some definite over-sharing, but it was refreshing from a member of a family that is so incredibly closed off. I could do with out ever seeing a reference to a todger ever again in my lifetime, but other than that, this was a book that I was simply unable to put down. I found myself wanting to know what came next and what he was going to say next. While this is a chunkier book, it absolutely flies by, and while there are a lot of chapters, they are short and are told in a vignette style that actually breaks this up pretty nicely. Everyone has their own opinions about the royal family and more specifically on Harry and Meghan and how they fit in, but I was impressed with this memoir and how much Harry decided to share. You cannot deny that the media have become a strong third member in their relationship, and they have gone through an experience with that not many people will ever be able to understand.

Rating 4 out of 5,"I really enjoyed hearing Prince Harry’s story in his own words. I especially enjoyed the audiobook! I could listen to him talk for longer than 15 hours 😂 the book was a bit of a roller coaster ride, starting from princess diana’s death and going through Harry’s teenage years, his time in the military, his multiple trips to Africa, his girlfriends, and until he met Meg and their story. All throughout the book was the constant underlying theme of the press and palace HR undermining him. I feel like some parts of the story weren’t necessary for us to read or grasp the point, but I did overall enjoy this very much!

Prefacing by saying that I am rating it 5 stars for the narration and the writing. Harry makes the story all the more impactful by narrating it himself. My rating has nothing to do with the content of the story. I cannot judge the man for his life choices and decisions. His circumstances are his. His decisions his.
It's difficult to not feel some kind of sympathy towards Harry and Meghan for everything they went through. It's sad that the relationship between Harry and William is so bad. I'm convinced that going to therapy together would have helped somehow. For all the mental health advocacy that they do, they should take care of their own mental healths.Some of his troubles do feel relatable (in as much as relatable one might find one's life compared to a royal family member): how he was sure that his mom had gone into hiding and that she had not died, the sibling rivalry, the sense of being left back when everyone else seems to be moving on. The thing is, be it mistakes or any moments, everything in his life is blown up for the whole world to see. Some people would say that that's the price to pay for being in a prominent family. But where's the limit? The constant hounding of the media, the relentless digging into their lives, the danger. Where does it end? And the way the palace feeds into it, how family members use it to put themselves in a good light? It's such a high-stress and toxic environment.(I also can't get over how they live. Needing to take appointments to meet family members. Being summoned, or told to follow protocol. Having to renounce one's wants to not cause any ripples). This, overall, was just heartbreaking.Show more",5,"Prefacing by saying that I am rating it 5 stars for the narration and the writing Harry makes the story all the more impactful by narrating it himself My rating has nothing to do with the content of the story I cannot judge the man for his life choices and decisions His circumstances are his His decisions his

Rating 3 out of 5,I will say that I picked this one up strictly due to all the hype around it. I don't like rating biographies since it doesn't seem fair to rate somebody's personal experiences. What I will say is that it was an interesting read and was really eye opening especially hearing more about his childhood. I applaud him for all the work he has done for his mental health and in bringing more awareness to the subject of mental health in general. This is just his side of the the story but he did what he thought was best for his family and in the end that is what you need to do so kudos to him.

Rating 4 out of 5,"There's a scene in the most recent season of The Crown, which may or may not be made up: a TV producer, after seeing Diana's bombshell (there were three of us in this marriage) interview, essentially says, we should not air this. This woman is not well, she is in a horrible place mentally, that is very obvious, and it would exploitative to air this. Then they air it anyway.I kinda feel like maybe at some point during the creation of this book, a similar conversation may have happened. And they published it anyway.Look, it's a good book, and it's certainly entertaining. Harry himself narrates the audio and he does a great job. The language is a bit flowery in some places, and the military bits felt a little dry (a soldier I am not) but overall, it was a good book. But it has some yikes moments for sure. Did you ever have questions about Harry's penis? Chances are this book answers them! There was 100% more penis content than I was mentally prepared for. Some of it is pretty funny but sweet Jesus, so much penis!Harry clearly has a LOT of ""Big T"" Trauma. I mean obviously, right? We all know that. I was heartbroken to read that he had 100% convinced himself that she had gone into hiding rather than actually died, and that one day he would reunite with her. Also...yeah, they packed him right back up to boarding school immediately after her funeral. Back to normal! He'll be fine. As a mom, that was beyond awful to read. I realize is was the 90s and the focus on mental health was nowhere near what it is now, but ouch. That poor kid.Some other things that stand out: Harry has an understandably very rosy view of his mom. We know now, and he must have known then, that she was a complicated woman. Beloved, kind, caring, of course. But she certainly had her issues and flaws. It was interesting that he either wasn't aware of them (he does share one thing about her parenting that he struggled with) or just chooses not to address them. He clearly feels the same way about Megan. I know she has legions of haters, but I have to tell you, he seems genuinely smitten. They remind me of Barack and Michelle--you can't fake that love and respect. That's genuine, and I'm happy for them. I hope they are able to weather the storms and find some peace.There is one scene that is almost a throwaway, in which Harry's therapist tells him that in her opinion, he is addicted to reading press stories about himself. Over and over family members and friends encourage him to ignore it. I fully understand him not wanting to or not being able to ignore the racist vitriol hurled at his wife. But the amount of time he has spent in his life obsessing over what has been said about him or what MIGHT be said about him in the papers is really astounding. There is clearly a great deal of healing to be done there. I hope he gets the help and peace that he needs.Show more",4,Theres a scene in the most recent season of The Crown which may or may not be made up a TV producer after seeing Dianas bombshell there were three of us in this marriage interview essentially says we should not air this This woman is not well she is in a horrible place mentally that is very obvious and it would exploitative to air this Then they air it anywayI kinda feel like maybe at some point during the creation of this book a similar conversation may have happened And they published it anywayLook its a good book and its certainly entertaining Harry himself narrates the audio and he does a great job The language is a bit flowery in some places and the military bits felt a little dry a soldier I am not but overall it was a good book But it has some yikes moments for sure Did you ever have questions about Harrys penis Chances are this book answers them There was 100 more penis content than I was mentally prepared for Some of it is pretty funny but sweet Jesus so much penisHarry clearly has a LOT of Big T Trauma I mean obviously right We all know that I was heartbroken to read that he had 100 convinced himself that she had gone into hiding rather than actually died and that one day he would reunite with her Alsoyeah they packed him right back up to boarding school immediately after her funeral Back to normal Hell be fine As a mom that was beyond awful to read I realize is was the 90s and the focus on mental health was nowhere near what it is now but ouch That poor kidSome other things that stand out Harry has an understandably very rosy view of his mom We know now and he must have known then that she was a complicated woman Beloved kind caring of course But she certainly had her issues and flaws It was interesting that he either wasnt aware of them he does share one thing about her parenting that he struggled with or just chooses not to address them He clearly feels the same way about Megan I know she has legions of haters but I have to tell you he seems genuinely smitten They remind me of Barack and Michelleyou cant fake that love and respect Thats genuine and Im happy for them I hope they are able to weather the storms and find some peaceThere is one scene that is almost a throwaway in which Harrys therapist tells him that in her opinion he is addicted to reading press stories about himself Over and over family members and friends encourage him to ignore it I fully understand him not wanting to or not being able to ignore the racist vitriol hurled at his wife But the amount of time he has spent in his life obsessing over what has been said about him or what MIGHT be said about him in the papers is really astounding There is clearly a great deal of healing to be done there I hope he gets the help and peace that he needsShow more
Rating 5 out of 5,"Audiobook Review5+ starsSpare is a poignant, fascinating, exceedingly well-written memoir. Prince Harry offers an intimate account of his decades-long struggle with grief following the death of his mother, as well his search for purpose as someone other than the spare to brother Prince William’s heir. The book is broken up into three parts: Harry’s adolescent years, his time in the military, and his relationship with Meghan Markle and their controversial retreat from royal life. Prince Harry bursts the bubble of royal mystique to reveal a cold, dysfunctional family mired in petty jealousy and an intense focus on gaining public popularity. However, Harry also speaks of fond memories, and he expresses love for his family in addition to a lifetime of yearning for their love, understanding, and acceptance. There are chapters that are simply heartrending.Harry doesn’t shy away from exposing his own flaws, including anger, deep denial, sibling rivalry, and using unhealthy methods to cope with anxiety and emotional pain. His frank insight into mental health is moving. I’m a sucker for a good love story, so I soaked up all the details about Harry and Meghan's whirlwind romance. I admit I cringed a little at the occasional over-sharing—I really don’t need to know anything about Harry’s twig and berries—but it’s done with good humor.The other main thread woven throughout is Harry’s condemnation of the toxic relationship between the monarchy and the British press. Contrary to his family’s motto of never complain; never explain, Harry claims the palace uses leaks, courtiers, and anonymous “sources” to get its messages published in tabloids. Forced into the role of the spare/scapegoat, Prince Harry has been subjected to harmful, false stories planted in the press about him and then later on, his wife. The purpose? To squash less than flattering pieces about more senior members of the royal family and to boost their image.Whether or not the understanding and accountability he seeks with his family is attainable given some of his revelations and accusations remains to be seen. However, it is clear that he has finally found peace, love, and purpose in this new chapter of his life.I can’t recommend the audiobook highly enough. It boasts masterful narration by Prince Harry. His voice oozes with warmth, self-deprecating humor, and vulnerability. He is one of the best narrators I’ve ever heard.Recommended for fans of:The royal familyMemoirsMilitaryAudiobooks

Rating 2 out of 5,"I’m not going to finish the book. I was looking forward to reading this book as a RF fan and a Meghan fan. I loved Suits and The Tig. My awe of the monarchy probably started with the wedding of Charles and Diana. Even before that, visiting the UK and the pomp and circumstance of the guards, jewels, the Tower of London was pretty memorable as a 5th grade girl.That being said, I don’t think the writing is great. I put down 50 Shades of Grey too. So, I realize I’m not always on the side of what’s popular. It felt a little like a teenager journal at times. And I realized I learned so much from the interviews that nothing was jaw dropping. I’m at the point in my life that I will put down a book if my time isn’t being well spent. 5 years ago I might have pushed through but I have too many books that I can’t wait to read on my kindle.Show more",2,Im not going to finish the book I was looking forward to reading this book as a RF fan and a Meghan fan I loved Suits and The Tig My awe of the monarchy probably started with the wedding of Charles and Diana Even before that visiting the UK and the pomp and circumstance of the guards jewels the Tower of London was pretty memorable as a 5th grade girlThat being said I dont think the writing is great I put down 50 Shades of Grey too So I realize Im not always on the side of whats popular It felt a little like a teenager journal at times And I realized I learned so much from the interviews that nothing was jaw dropping Im at the point in my life that I will put down a book if my time isnt being well spent 5 years ago I might have pushed through but I have too many books that I cant wait to read on my kindleShow more
Rating 4 out of 5,"Prince Harry strikes me as a tender-hearted man and well-intentioned. This book offers an inside look at what it’s like to grow up a Prince, and of course it’s also a love story. The hate directed towards Markle has indeed been unhinged and racist, but one wishes Harry had been able to take the advice of his father and brother and ignore the press. It’s not surprising that Harry, who remains scarred by his mother’s death, essentially at the hands of paparazzi, seemingly can’t. Pretty sure the Prince, who admits he’s not a reader, did not actually write this book, so kudos to the ghost-writer, this book is exceptionally well-written. I’d recommend it.

Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 STARS - I'm not a royal watcher by any means but I am nosy and wanted to get Prince Harry's take on things, so I bought this audiobook. To me, Harry seemed to be one of the royals who went against the grain (not unlike his Aunt Margaret) and was unafraid to stand up for what he believes in - like his mother. You know there's a good story there.Spare felt like it was a cathartic release for Harry, who still feels the effects of his mother’s loss. I cannot imagine a life where every behaviour and word spoke was judged by others or being raised in a family who had rigid rules and limited emotional capabilities. In this memoir, Harry is vulnerable as he shares his most intimate moments of his childhood, his deep grief for his mother, his complicated relationships with his family and what it was like to live in a fishbowl.This is an excellent book to listen to and I'm not sure I would have enjoyed it as much in print format. Prince Harry tells his story in his own voice and his emotion and humour come through. He gets emotional talking about his mother, and you can see how he continues to live in the shadow of her death but also in her compassionate legacy. You hear the excitement and love when he finds Meghan - not since his mom has he had such an uncomplicated and accepting bond with someone.His relationships with his dad and brother are much more complicated, structured and rigid. There's a bond between the men (Camilla, not s'much), but you can see how their relationships are influenced by their roles and rank in the royal family. I liked that Harry spills the tea and shares juicy gossip about his family - his relationships with other royals, what life was like growing up with paparazzi hounding him (or making up slanderous headlines to sell papers). I found his brother and father's nicknames humorous and incongruous, and the sibling rivalry surprised me the most. Compared to his brother, the heir, as 'The Spare', Harry had more freedom to explore life, make mistakes and I think that took its toll on his relationship with his brother William who was raised to 'drink the royal Kool-Aid' from birth and didn't have the ability to make similar choices as the heir to the throne.But Harry tends to lean towards oversharing with his readers. Did we need pages devoted to his frozen 'todger', his drug use or petty comments about his brother and their 'on again, off again' sibling rivalry? No. My least favourite part of the book was his long descriptions of his life in the military. I appreciate how proud he is to have served and made contributions to his country's military but didn't enjoy his long-winded war stories. Harry is impetuous and has made horrendous mistakes over the years and I'm sure writing this book has been liberating for him - to get it all out. I'm not sure if this book will benefit him or hinder him and his family in the future. I've always been confused at the vehement vitriol that some people have towards Harry and Meghan. After listening to Harry detail what life was like for him and Meghan, I cannot fault them for wanting to get out.I'm glad I listened to this book, and I enjoyed getting Harry's take on things and appreciated his candor and his down-to-earth conversational tone which had an intimate quality to it. I liked hearing him talk about his relationships with his royal family, his love for his wife and children, his deep connection to Africa and his memories of his mom. Everyone will continue to have opinions on Harry, but I wish him and Meghan well and I believe their intentions to do good in this world. I hope by telling his story, his family can find happiness and some peace.

Rating 1 out of 5,"I actually read this book right after midnight when it was delivered to my iPad. I'm a fast reader, so it took me only about 2 1/2 hours. I have relatives who have worked for King Charles and Queen Consort Camilla, so I do kind of have some interest in the British Royal Family. (For what it's worth, my relatives say both Charles and Camilla are kind and caring people, and they respect both of them.)At first, I thought the book was well written (Harry didn't write it, he hired a ghostwriter and paid him one million US dollars), but after about thirty pages, the material began to get boring. There was just nothing in it that was compelling. I knew Harry called the late Queen Elizabeth, ""Granny,"" and the late Princess Diana, ""Mummy,"" and even that he called his brother, ""Willy"" and William called him, ""Harold"" despite his given name being Henry. However, I was surprised and slightly amused that he called King Charles, ""Pa,"" or that King Charles called Harry, ""Darling Boy."" (Those were about the best parts of the book.)The most laughable thing in this book, however, is the fact that Harry throws shade at who else but Queen Consort Camilla for being divorced and attempting to marry into the Royal Family. That made me laugh out loud. Is Harry so thick he fails to see he need look no further than his own bed partner to find a divorced woman who set her cap for a prince? And, Camilla has never shown the slightest concern for titles. While she was, technically, the Princess of Wales, she gladly accepted the lower title of Duchess of Cornwall, instead, and she was ready to be crowned Princess Consort to Charles' King. It was the late Queen Elizabeth and Parliament who begged to differ. Meanwhile, Harry and Meghan cling to their titles like hangers-on at the edge of an already-full lifeboat.After months of reading that the revelations in this book would shatter the Royal Family (I hoped they would not and didn't think they would), this book said nothing about anyone that wasn't simply lukewarm. The book reminded me of a bowl of cream of wheat with no milk or sugar or fruit or anything else. Just bland as can be.So William doesn't like Meghan. Does it matter that much? It's Harry who married her. Had Harry and Meghan remained in the UK, William and Meghan wouldn't have interacted all that much. Their royal duties would, I think, not have been carried out in tandem.So there was a rift between Meghan and Kate over Kate's formality and Meghan's lack of formality. Again, what does it matter? The two are sisters-in-law, not conjoined twins. And the misunderstanding about Princess Charlotte's dress wasn't any different than the misunderstandings most families have once in a while. (I have a cousin I haven't spoken to in years because she misinterpreted something I said, and even though I apologized for her misunderstanding, she'd rather be right than resume the family relationship. Who really cares? I don't. And by the way, I have a wonderful relationship with her mother, my aunt, who didn't misunderstand me at all.)All in all, the book came off as the picture of a man-child, who, nearing forty, cannot get over the death of his mother when he was just two weeks shy of his thirteenth birthday. I can sympathize with Harry over Diana's tragic death, and I realize how very traumatic that had to be, but his constant whining about the paparazzi killing her is just wrong. She died because she and her lover decided to get into a car with a drunk driver. (I'm not blaming the victims, but really Dodi should have been protecting Diana more and told Trevor Rhys-Jones, who was sober, to drive.) Diana was the most photographed woman in the world; she was used to being pursued by the paparazzi even if she didn't like it. I think, if she had a voice in the decision, she would have chosen to protect her life over arriving at Dodi's Parisian home quickly. But I know. People always think it won't happen to them, and Diana and Dodi had such a short distance to travel. But Harry blaming the paparazzi is just wrong.The book also paints a picture of a man who cannot get over the fact that he was the ""spare,"" and not the heir. As I was reading, I kept thinking, ""Get over it, Harry. What if you actually had to work for a living, live in a small house or apartment, and worry about how to pay the bills each month?"" Life isn't fair. We all have things about our lives we wish could have been different.Harry and Meghan said they moved to the US because they wanted privacy. I wish they'd live up to that statement. I don't hate either one of them, but I don't like them, either. I don't know them. I am weary of them. I'm tired of hearing about them on the news. I'm tired of seeing stories about them on the Internet when I'm not searching for stories about them. I don't know if this book was therapeutic for Harry or whether he wrote it for the money, but I do think he should donate all of the money to the African charities he says he loves.This book damages Harry and Meghan far more than it damages anyone in the British Royal Family, and it's boring as well. I can't recommend buying it and investing time in it unless you're as wealthy as Harry is and don't care how much money you spend. Even if you are a multimillionaire, there are many better things to read out there than the account of the life of a self-pitying man who refuses to grow up.Show more",1,I actually read this book

Rating 5 out of 5,"I’m trying to think about what to say about this buzzy new memoir that hasn’t already been said by so many other readers. Rather than rehash a version of, say, Rae’s spot-on review (which I agree with every word of), I’ll write instead about some of the more bonkers things we learn about Harry using the old party game “Two Truths and a Lie”: • Harry delivers a toast at Will and Kate’s wedding reception at which he presents a furry thong made out of ermine to the blushing bride.• Harry goes on an expedition to the North Pole, where he develops frostbite on various parts of his body, including his “todger”.• Harry loves the sitcom F•R•I•E•N•D•S and hooks up with one of the cast members while on a trip to America.Okay, that last one is DEFINITELY a lie. But Harry really is obsessed with the series (which he watched on repeat while suffering from depression post-combat duty). And he DOES meet his favorite Friend, Courtney Cox, while staying at her place in LA. (It’s during said trip that Harry trips on mushrooms and has a very Seth Rogen-esque moment with a bathroom trash can—another weird truth that legitimately made me laugh out loud!)A final bonkers revelation touches on Spare’s popularity. As I write this (the same month it came out), the memoir has sold more than 3.2 million copies worldwide.

Rating 5 out of 5,"I listened to this on audiobook and there’s always just something about hearing the author’s story through their own voice. This was such an emotional, raw autobiography that painted a picture of a life so many of us have only seen through the lens of others. I’m happy that this book has allowed Harry to take the reins of the narrative that so many have tried to control. The last part of the book definitely had me emotional and thinking of the lengths I would go to in order to clear my name, speak my truth, and perhaps, mostly importantly, protect my family. And I think that’s what Harry has done here. This wasn’t an easy read/listen. There were moments of grief, trauma, and healing. But I think it’s an important read that sheds light on how important it is for people to realize that we truly don’t know what people are going through. 💗Show more",5,I listened to this on audiobook and theres always just something about hearing the authors story through their own voice This was such an emotional raw autobiography that painted a picture of a life so many of us have only seen through the lens of others Im happy that this book has allowed Harry to take the reins of the narrative that so many have tried to control The last part of the book definitely had me emotional and thinking of the lengths I would go to in order to clear my name speak my truth and perhaps mostly importantly protect my family And I think thats what Harry has done here This wasnt an easy readlisten There were moments of grief trauma and healing But I think its an important read that sheds light on how important it is for people to realize that we truly dont know what people are going through Show more
Rating 4 out of 5,"✨ ""They can't break me, I thought. Is it, I wondered, because I'm already broken?""My advice: Go in with an open mind!I surprised myself by devouring all 400 pages of this memoir in one day, wow. It definitely surpassed my expectations to the point that I was disappointed to find out that it was ghostwritten. All the headlines, articles and quotes you have heard about this book... forget them. I feel like a lot has been taken out of context e.g. the army killings and Elizabeth Arden cream (IYKYK) because nothing stuck out to me as a red flag when I read the book.The parts that stood out for me most are definitely when Harry talks about his mother. I feel like I gained a deeper understanding of his grief, trauma and how all of it has shaped him and his choices. And wow, this seriously broke my heart:
""Yes, I've already lost my mum, of course, but I'm afraid that by talking about her, now, here, to a perfect stranger, and perhaps alleviating some of the pain of that loss, I'll be losing her again. I'll be losing that feeling, that presence of her — or what I've always felt as her presence.""You see... the pain... if that's what it is... that's all I have left of her. And the pain is also what drives me. Some days the pain is the only thing holding me together. And also, I suppose, without the pain, well, she might think... I've forgotten her.""
It's also evident why he loves Meghan and would do anything to protect her. And oh, to have someone talk about you like that...

Rating 3 out of 5,"This book made me realise why I don't like Non Fiction books. I have trust issues. When I'm reading fiction I KNOW for a FACT none of it is real, I know how to rate it, I know how to review it because it's NOT REAL. While with Non Fiction (especially Biographies), I either have to choose to FULLY believe the author or what's the point in reading it in the first place. But I STRUGGLE with that, and it's not just because this is Prince Harry, I thought the same about Obamas biography, Tom Feltons one, it's not them it's me I AM THE PROBLEM. I'm giving this book 2.5 stars because objectively the writing isn't GREAT, it feels like it could have gone through a GOOD FEW MORE EDITS and maybe rewording BUT GOD IT DOES SUCK YOU IN. I read this for the drama, for the gossip, I gave into the hype. I mean if you hear that Prince Harry is talking about his frost bitten penis AT THE FUTURE KINGS WEDDING, how do you resist finding out if that's ACTUALLY in the book or if it's a publicity stunt. LET ME TELL YOU I fully expected all the stuff coming out about this book before it was published to be just that, a publicity stunt, getting people interested, getting people to buy the book. But no, IT'S ALL IN THERE, EVERY SINGLE THING I SAW ONLINE THE WEEK BEFORE THIS WAS RELEASED IS ACTUALLY IN THE BOOK, which shocked me TO MY CORE. ANYWAY, yeah I surprisingly enjoyed it, it felt very fast paced but to be fair man had a lot of ground to cover. I don't love the Royal Family, when Harry and Meghan left I thought good for them but honestly I didn't care, because I don't, a generationally rich family? With drama? At least the Kardashians dad worked his ass off, what do these people do? Sit in their 100s of fancy houses and care about whether or not someone shuts a car door after themselves. ACTUALLY I lied I do care about the royal family, they PISS ME OFF. BUT regardless of your opinion on the Royal Family there should be NO DOUBT that Meghan did NOT deserve any of what the press put her through during her whole relationship and marriage with Harry. It was insane, P.S. FUCK PIERS MORGAN. Anyway, reading those chapters did make me feel for Harry and Meghan because I knew that they WERE hounded so there was at least SOME truth to it. But also they left the royal family because they didn't want to be hounded by press but then went onto TV interviews and docuseries and release A BOOK? All which would bring more press attention? Like yeah totally speak your truth, I really don't care how this will 'affect' the royal family, that is not my problem. But similarly, I do not understand why anyone WOULD care about the royal family so much that they'd send death threats to Meghan and Harry and get SO WORKED UP about what LITERAL STRANGERS ARE DOING?! (Unless they are Prince Andrew sexually assaulting young girls, that's one thing people SHOULD care about and yet it's the thing royalists care about the least?! MAKE IT MAKE SENSE.) Do I believe everything written in this book? No, but I also don't know what to believe, which makes it hard to form an opinion. Am I glad I read it? Yeah for sure, it was fun, it will have 0 IMPACT on my life and my opinion on the Royal Family and Harry and Meghan have not changed because I have other things to care about. But truly, good for him, I hope him and Meghan and their children live happy healthy lives, I hope this book brings him a lotta money from all the people who hate them buying it just to read it. BUT next time Harry, please check when the Xbox was released (2001) before claiming you received it in 1997.

There is so much trauma and grief in his life - much of which he has not had the chance to work in resolving until recently3.

Rating 4 out of 5,"Alright, I’m going to start by saying that I have some really ambiguous thoughts when it comes to this book. While there’s a lot of things I don’t agree with, I did find most of it incredibly intriguing and I ultimately flew through it. When the title was released, I must admit I had no idea where “Spare” had come from but after hearing Harry say he was called that by his father his entire life, I can understand the pain that has caused him. He says that his father said to his mother “Now you’ve given me an heir and a spare.”While I initially had reservations if I even wanted to read this as I didn’t agree with Harry and Meghan saying they wanted to live a private life then choose to release a Netflix special and tell all memoir back to back just seems immensely hypocritical. At times, he did come across extremely winey but in the end, I do feel for him as he didn’t choose this life and the subsequent traumatic childhood he experienced following his mothers death and dealing with an absentee father.I enjoyed several of the juicy bits and the general pulling back of the curtains of the royals. I applaud him for speaking his truth as he got pretty raw, but did I need to know about his raw penis? Probably not. 😂Did he need to tell us his brother assaulted him? Probably not either - my guess is after this, there is zero chance of reconciliation or relationship mending which is sad as we watched them have such a memorable bond in their early years. In the end, I just hope him and Meghan get what they wanted from this book and getting their story out there and that ultimately, he didn’t/doesn’t make things worse.

Rating 2 out of 5,"DNF The first odd hours I listened to are too boring. To be clear, I wasn’t looking for gossip or drama but I also didn’t want to read chapter after chapter about Harry’s days at school as a boy either. I was looking for a more adult memoir with reflection than a biography. I liked that he read it though; he has a nice voice. Note: I have never cared about the royals. I couldn’t tell you Willy’s kids names. I have never been to Buckingham palace despite having been to London 4 times. Haven’t watched a single wedding, etc. I didn’t even make it through the first episode of The Crown on Netflix 😆 Yet I somehow had opinions about members of the family.After recently watching a documentary on JLO, I realized my entire adult life I thought she was “a diva” but she actually isn’t, that’s just what the racist smut media wanted me to believe… so that led me to wonder if my thoughts about these royals were similarly “off”I picked this book up because of that and because I too grew up in dysfunction and had to pretend otherwise, and pretend that I had a good family for the sake of public image when in actuality I was raised by an abusive narcissist I loathe (and have since escaped).I wanted to see and be seen. In some of the early chapters I felt that: so much was familiar to me and I felt for Harry, I really did… but then much more bored me and I didn’t understand the point; it was too “biography” and too little “memoir” for me. Maybe it gets better? Idk 15 hours is a hard sell when I have 8 left and am already bored. I hope audible refunds me 😂 I ended up watching the Harry and Megan documentary instead.Show more",2,DNF The first odd hours I listened to are too boring To be clear I wasnt looking for gossip or drama but I also didnt want to read chapter after chapter about Harrys days at school as a boy either I was looking for a more adult memoir with reflection than a biography I liked that he read it though he has a nice voice Note I have never cared about the royals I couldnt tell you Willys kids names I have never been to Buckingham palace despite having been to London 4 times Havent watched a single wedding etc I didnt even make it through the first episode of The Crown on Netflix  Yet I somehow had opinions about members of the familyAfter recently watching a documentary on JLO I realized my entire adult life I thought she was a diva but she actually isnt thats just what the racist smut media wanted me to believe so that led me to wonder if my thoughts about these royals were similarly offI picked this book up because of that and because I too grew up in dysfunction and had to pretend otherwise and pretend that I had a good family for the sake of public image when in actuality I was raised by an abusive narcissist I loathe and have since escapedI wanted to see and be seen In some of the early chapters I felt that so much was familiar to me and I felt for Harry I really did but then much more bored me and I didnt understand the point it was too biography and too little memoir for me Maybe it gets better Idk 15 hours is a hard sell when I have 8 left and am already bored I hope audible refunds me  I ended up watching the Harry and Megan documentary insteadShow more

Rating 4 out of 5,"This book doesn't need an introduction-- if you live anywhere in the Western world, you've heard about it. But just in case you haven't, this is Prince Harry's tell-all (or, if he's to be believed, heavily edited down tell-most).All of the book's most sordid details have already been covered ad nauseam by the press. We all know that William, the Prince of Wales, allegedly physically attacked Harry in an argument over Meghan. We have first person confirmation of Harry's copious use of drugs. We know about Harry's loss of virginity behind a bar to an older woman who rode him like a horse. We even know about Harry's frostbitten penis.So, instead of talking more about the content of the book, I wanted to talk about my experience in reading it, and then, for something completely unexpected, about King Charles, Harry's father. Reading this book got a lot better for me when I started to let myself relax into it and treat it like a work of fiction rather than a memoir. Whether Harry is a reliable narrator, and if so to what degree, was the most interesting question that this book presented for me. Unfortunately, unlike many novels where an unreliable narrator is used to great affect, there's never any wink toward the audience that helps you guess what the objective truth is. Harry admits himself he has no memory for conversations, and that he was on drugs for large portions of his youth. He is also self-evidently attempting to present himself and his new nuclear family in the most favorable light possible while throwing almost everyone else under the bus-- I think the only person outside his current nuclear family who is talked about at length and escapes relatively unscathed is his first serious girlfriend, Chelsy Davy. It's also obvious in the book that Harry has mental health issues, and that these were at times what I'd call severe-- it's possible they still are. At the same time, the book somehow has a ring of veracity that leads me to think that Harry is speaking his truth. The question of whether this is actually the truth is a different one, and I'm inclined to think the answer is 'no'. Interestingly, despite Harry's dogged determination to present King Charles as the worst father imaginable, he ends up coming across as an altogether decent dad. Harry, on the other hand, comes across as quite spoiled and entitled in their interactions. I understand that their dynamic is heavily shaped by Harry's hero worship of his mother, and the way in which his father failed his mother. But Harry fails to make a real case for how Charles failed him. He talks about a man who, despite heavy social engagements, would sit with him every single night until he fell asleep because he was afraid to be alone in the dark. He talks about a man who would leave heartfelt notes about how proud he was of him on his pillow (not good enough for Harry, who evidently can only tolerate hearing praise directly and in person). He talks about a man who attended his school play and laughed uproariously, and how furious he was because Charles laughed at the 'wrong' parts. He talks about his immature and crazy request that Charles never marry again as though this was something reasonable to demand of a person, and still to this day seems to view it as a huge betrayal that Charles went ahead and married again anyway. He talks about a thoughtful, scholarly man who is mild mannered and cares for and respects the Earth. I'd rather have Charles in my life than Harry any day if this book is anything do go on.I would wholeheartedly recommend this anyone with any interest in the British royal family-- 100% guaranteed you'll be suitably entertained. But I'd also take it all with a grain of salt, because, while objective truth is out there, we'll never find it. This is especially true since almost all of the very people who Harry is bashing aren't able to respond to the accusations against them in any substantive way.Show more",4,This book doesnt need an introduction if you live anywhere in the Western world youve heard about it But just in case you havent this is Prince Harrys tellall or if hes to be believed heavily edited down tellmostAll of the books most sordid details have already been covered ad nauseam by the press We all know that William the Prince of Wales allegedly physically attacked Harry in an argument over Meghan We have first person confirmation of Harrys copious use of drugs We know about Harrys loss of virginity behind a bar to an older woman who rode him like a horse We even know about Harrys frostbitten penisSo instead of talking more about the content of the book I wanted to talk about my experience in reading it and then for something completely unexpected about King Charles Harrys father Reading this book got a lot better for me when I started to let myself relax into it and treat it like a work of fiction rather than a memoir Whether Harry is a reliable narrator and if so to what degree was the most interesting question that this book presented for me Unfortunately unlike many novels where an unreliable narrator is used to great affect theres never any wink toward the audience that helps you guess what the objective truth is Harry admits himself he has no memory for conversations and that he was on drugs for large portions of his youth He is also selfevidently attempting to present himself and his new nuclear family in the most favorable light possible while throwing almost everyone else under the bus I think the only person outside his current nuclear family who is talked about at length and escapes relatively unscathed is his first serious girlfriend Chelsy Davy Its also obvious in the book that Harry has mental health issues and that these were at times what Id call severe its possible they still are At the same time the book somehow has a ring of veracity that leads me to think that Harry is speaking his truth The question of whether this is actually the truth is a different one and Im inclined to think the answer is no Interestingly despite Harrys dogged determination to present King Charles as the worst father imaginable he ends up coming across as an altogether decent dad Harry on the other hand comes across as quite spoiled and entitled in their interactions I understand that their dynamic is heavily shaped by Harrys hero worship of his mother and the way in which his father failed his mother But Harry fails to make a real case for how Charles failed him He talks about a man who despite heavy social engagements would sit with him every single night until he fell asleep because he was afraid to be alone in the dark He talks about a man who would leave heartfelt notes about how proud he was of him on his pillow not good enough for Harry who evidently can only tolerate hearing praise directly and in person He talks about a man who attended his school play and laughed uproariously and how furious he was because Charles laughed at the wrong parts He talks about his immature and crazy request that Charles never marry again as though this was something reasonable to demand of a person and still to this day seems to view it as a huge betrayal that Charles went ahead and married again anyway He talks about a thoughtful scholarly man who is mild mannered and cares for and respects the Earth Id rather have Charles in my life than Harry any day if this book is anything do go onI would wholeheartedly recommend this anyone with any interest in the British royal family 100 guaranteed youll be suitably entertained But Id also take it all with a grain of salt because while objective truth is out there well never find it This is especially true since almost all of the very people who Harry is bashing arent able to respond to the accusations against them in any substantive wayShow more
Rating 4 out of 5,"I wasn't going to read ""Spare"" because memoir is one of my least favorite genres and celebrity/political memoirs are usually the worst in terms of quality and content. However, my anti-monarchist curiosity got the best of me after watching the gutter press devolve into hysterics in the lead-up to the book's publication. It's not surprising, given that Harry paints UK tabloid culture as the ultimate villain in his life story. If I were The Daily Fail or one of those other rags, I'd be trying to deflect attention too.Just as Harry's family was surprised that an American actress might have a brain, and Harry was surprised that Terf Island and its tabloids might be super racist, I was surprised that I mostly liked this book. Celebrity memoirs are too often cash grabs by people who think being famous makes them interesting, and most political memoirs are glossy PR pieces. I didn't find every part of Harry's life story compelling, but no one can deny he's led a singular life, and while this book is a PR piece in a way, it gets into the nitty-gritty and paints a complicated, unflattering picture of the royal family.My compliments to the prince's ghostwriter, JR Moehringer. I listened to the audiobook, and the writing sounded natural and conversational when being narrated. The chapters are written in small, bite-size chunks, so the story flows quickly. There's a lot of material to cover, and it's organized well.My main criticism of this book is that the ideas probably would have been more cohesive if he'd waited a year or two to tell it. Not that I can really blame him for moving ahead when he did. I would have done the same if my family was getting daily death threats and security costs were in the millions per year. Still, it's clear he's spent a lot of time unpacking sexism and racism, but hardly touched the parts of his brain where nationalism and colonialism live, which I think is necessary if you're really going to try to understand and see racism. Harry can talk about his belief in monarchy and the crown all he wants, but this book makes it crystal clear that that family is truly broken and dysfunctional. I don't know how anyone could read this and still believe in monarchy. It's clear that the family members aren't being served well by being the public and media's chew toys, and it's also clear that the commonwealth public aren't being served well being represented by this pack of emotionally stunted egoists who care more about looking good than actually doing good.Show more",4,I wasnt going to read Spare because memoir is one of my least favorite genres and celebritypolitical memoirs are usually the worst in terms of quality and content However my antimonarchist curiosity got the best of me after watching the gutter press devolve into hysterics in the leadup to the books publication Its not surprising given that Harry paints UK tabloid culture as the ultimate villain in his life story If I were The Daily Fail or one of those other rags Id be trying to deflect attention tooJust as Harrys family was surprised that an American actress might have a brain and Harry was surprised that Terf Island and its tabloids might be super racist I was surprised that I mostly liked this book Celebrity memoirs are too often cash grabs by people who think being famous makes them interesting and most political memoirs are glossy PR pieces I didnt find every part of Harrys life story compelling but no one can deny hes led a singular life and while this book is a PR piece in a way it gets into the nittygritty and paints a complicated unflattering picture of the royal familyMy compliments to the princes ghostwriter JR Moehringer I listened to the audiobook and the writing sounded natural and conversational when being narrated The chapters are written in small bitesize chunks so the story flows quickly Theres a lot of material to cover and its organized wellMy main criticism of this book is that the ideas probably would have been more cohesive if hed waited a year or two to tell it Not that I can really blame him for moving ahead when he did I would have done the same if my family was getting daily death threats and security costs were in the millions per year Still its clear hes spent a lot of time unpacking sexism and racism but hardly touched the parts of his brain where nationalism and colonialism live which I think is necessary if youre really going to try to understand and see racism Harry can talk about his belief in monarchy and the crown all he wants but this book makes it crystal clear that that family is truly broken and dysfunctional I dont know how anyone could read this and still believe in monarchy Its clear that the family members arent being served well by being the public and medias chew toys and its also clear that the commonwealth public arent being served well being represented by this pack of emotionally stunted egoists who care more about looking good than actually doing goodShow more
Rating 4 out of 5,"I wouldn't call it compulsion to write this review, but it's definitely a need! Especially since I saw 1 star ratings from people who haven't read it but want to tank it because they call themselves royalists, patriots, or servants of Queen and Country. As a book lover, that drives me mad! My only claim to voyeurism is reading memoirs and biographies. I don't read tabloids or follow their accounts on any social platforms. There is so much to unpack here, but I just touched on a few main things......This was an eye opener into the archaic world of the monarchy. A case of art imitates life ... it reminded me of the ruthless pursuit of the iron throne in A Song of Ice and Fire. But it was more an insight into the mind of a young boy who lost his mother in his formative years and sought that connection in every relationship after that tragedy. His search for connection and feeling eventually transformed into a search for purpose and meaning. His troubles with his family stem from lack of communication and their need to portray a certain image as well as pander to the public. It is truly bizarre! Harry's constant confrontations with the lens of tabloids have made his life hell. As it was for his mother, and that is his ultimate fear. Shedding a spotlight on current affairs or the world's problems using one's status is definitely not the same thing as tabloid reporters (they should definitely not be called journalists) hounding celebrities for skinner and scandal. It is the difference of these definitions that people fail to discern and accuse Harry of doing in wanting to tell their truth by documentary or memoir.Terms like ""the price you pay"" or ""you know what you signed up for"" are haphazard and careless when people's safety are at risk. They seem to be brandished as the ultimate responses from the uninformed, uneducated, and those who lack empathy. It's Harry's life and his POV. Ultimately, it's his story told through a skilled ghost writer who kept the tone and integrity of his subject. Most importantly, for the reader to keep in mind is that we all view life through our own biases. Lastly, never underestimate the importance of a biro! *Some factual inconsistencies have arisen, and both Harry and his ghost writer, J.

Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 starsSpare confirmed my opinion that Harry and Meghan made the right decision to leave their royal duties and England after all they went through, which was primarily a result of the ""paps"" as Harry calls them - the paps that hounded his mother to her shocking and tragic death. This is not to say that they won't be stalked here by the relentless and ruthless paparazzi, but hopefully the paps will not take such an interest in their lives now that they are removed from palace conflicts. No longer muzzled by the palace press office, Harry tells his version of the Machiavellian games that go on between the palace press office, the royals themselves, and the rag sheets. Personally I believe and support Harry's version and his decision to leave England and his ""royal duties"" for the sake of his family and sanity. This book was also a very sad read in many places, starting with the death of his mother and her funeral when he was twelve years old.Harry didn't shy away from talking about his immature decisions and partying over the years and the therapy he finally undertook. However, the book at 410 pages was WAY too long and had TMI. So much of it could have been excised. I could have done without hearing about animals and hundreds of birds killed on hunting trips and family get-togethers, which apparently is just a normal part of royal life - justified, even lauded, and at one point described as being ""close to nature."" p.399 Even though I was interested in Harry's Army career and amazed at the lengthy and rigorous training he went through to learn to fly Apache helicopters and what he experienced in Afghanistan, I felt that part was too long. I was especially horrified at the torture training that Harry went through before he went back to Afghanistan a second time. That part could definitely have been cut!I was surprised and disappointed that there weren't any photos. OK, there were five, two on the dust jacket and one very small one at the beginning of each part of the book. But maybe he couldn't get permission to use any of the royal family photos? However, there were no recent photos of Meghan and his children either.Overall, I am glad that I read this book which corrected some of my misconceptions of events covered by the tabloid press. Not that I am in the habit of reading rag sheets, but their stories spread like a virus to even reputable news sites. I'm happy that Meghan won her case against the gutter press, but sadly it won't stop them. I hope Harry, Meghan and their family will find the peace and happiness that they need now that they are out of the center of the storm. This book is a good start on a new life, summed up with Harry's touching dedication, ""For Meg and Archie and Lili . . . and, of course, my mother.""

Rating 1 out of 5,"I went into this book with an open mind as I have seen this from both sides I’ve always said the press has treated Meghan abysmally and they have been racist towards her.My issue is Harry has to constantly play the victim in every situation and he has gone through every event to skew it like he’s been wronged or victimised. He says he wants a reconciliation with his father and brother I don’t see how that is possible as he really comes for them in this book. On particular he is very vitriolic towards William and seems to have no love or affection for him based on the way he speaks about him.There are just too many inconsistencies on one hand he says he was upset that William didn’t tell him he was going to propose to Kate then later on in the book says when had to ask permission to Marry Meghan from the Queen he doesn’t remember William having to ask. Both those statements cannot be true and surely if he as the spare (as he mentions every chance he gets) had to get permission surely the heir would have to do even more so.Some parts are just disturbing like saying he used cream his mother used to use when he had a problem with his genitals and it reminded him of his mother like why do we need to know that sort of thing.It just comes across like he is a petulant, jealous child who wanted to be the King and resents William for this.Also some of the things he gets upset by just astound me crying that William is winning he has a wife and kids whilst he eats takeaway over his dads sink.He gets upset that Camilla changed his bedroom into a dressing room when he left at the age of 28, like that’s normal most parents do that once you leave home.One of the funniest things that made me actually life was Pa only gave me an allowance for formal clothes, if I wanted normal clothes I had to use the sales rack.Also all his moaning about his accommodation, if you didn’t like it find somewhere yourself that you have to pay for.He goes into great detail on certain things like when William allegedly assaulted him but then gives very scarce details on other things which comes across as disingenuous like with the best man at Williams wedding where he can’t remember if William asked him or if it was the other way round, like that’s not something you would forget It is Harry who is obsessed by this Spare label and he seems very bitter about it and doesn’t let it go I don’t see him being able to move forward as he seems to want to stay on this bubble he’s created where everyone else is a villain and he is the victim.Of course his family will have done things wrong but I’m sure Harry and Meghan have as well and he keeps talking about people taking accountability (which he learnt to do in the army) but never does himself.This whole book has just been an exercise in narcissism and wanting to tear his brother apart Just in case

Rating 5 out of 5,"Wonderfully written and deeply personal. In my opinion, this book, at its core, is simply about a man and his experiences, about grief, love and personal growth. I was blown away by the vivid depictions of his life, including his travels and charity work throughout Africa and the recounting of his military career. His experience with British press, however, set my teeth on edge and I’m glad he finally has a chance to tell his own story.Listening to the audiobook (read by Harry) also added an additional personal touch which I enjoyed. At the end of the day, we’re all just human and it costs nothing to be kind to each other. I wish Harry, Meghan and their family all the best.Show more",5,Wonderfully written and deeply personal In my opinion this book at its core is simply about a man and his experiences about grief love and personal growth I was blown away by the vivid depictions of his life including his travels and charity work throughout Africa and the recounting of his military career His experience with British press however set my teeth on edge and Im glad he finally has a chance to tell his own storyListening to the audiobook read by Harry also added an additional personal touch which I enjoyed At the end of the day were all just human and it costs nothing to be kind to each other I wish Harry Meghan and their family all the bestShow more

Rating 5 out of 5,"This is getting 5 stars from me because I am sympathetic to Harry and Megan's plight. Also, it is my equivalent of the middle finger to the British press for being trash. Some context for you: I don't follow royals at all. I'm not only indifferent; I don't like the concept of inherited power of royalty/monarchy. Therefore, I was perfectly content to pass on reading this memoir mainly since I heard (through the press) it lumped into a category called ""Harry's complaints tour."" Sounds dull, I thought. Eventually, I changed my mind after talking with some level-headed personal friends who had heard Harry and Megan speak on Netflix/Oprah, etc., and were sympathetic. After reading this memoir, it turns out Harry is not complaining. He details several specific examples of false reports that the British press knowingly printed. This novel sounds like his attempt to set the record straight about his life. The ghostwriter did an excellent job crafting engaging stories about Harry's life. Not a complaint in sight from this reader, nor this author.Show more",5,This is getting 5 stars from me because I am sympathetic to Harry and Megans plight Also it is my equivalent of the middle finger to the British press for being trash Some context for you I dont follow royals at all Im not only indifferent I dont like the concept of inherited power of royaltymonarchy Therefore I was perfectly content to pass on reading this memoir mainly since I heard through the press it lumped into a category called Harrys complaints tour Sounds dull I thought Eventually I changed my mind after talking with some levelheaded personal friends who had heard Harry and Megan speak on NetflixOprah etc and were sympathetic After reading this memoir it turns out Harry is not complaining He details several specific examples of false reports that the British press knowingly printed This novel sounds like his attempt to set the record straight about his life The ghostwriter did an excellent job crafting engaging stories about Harrys life Not a complaint in sight from this reader nor this authorShow more
Rating 5 out of 5,"""...Once upon a time, there was a girl from L.A. Some people called her an actress. And there was a guy from London. Some people called him a prince. All of those people didn’t fully get it. Because this is the love story of a boy and a girl who were meant to be together."" - Meghan MarklePrince Harry's Spare was so much more than I expected: It was heartbreaking, touching, funny and candid. By the time I read this book, I'd already seen the Oprah interview and watched the Netflix documentary, but this book provided such beautiful, colorful, painful and raw insight into Harry's life and demonstrated that, despite being born into one of the most powerful families in the world, at the end of the day he is as human, flawed and broken as the rest of us. I understand the book was written by a ghostwriter, but it so perfectly captured his style, voice and truth that despite reading the print version, I could literally hear Harry speaking some parts of the book in my mind. Finishing this book feels like parting ways with a dear friend.The structure of the book flowed seamlessly: Part 1 covered Harry's tween and teen years following the loss of his beloved mother. Part 2 covered his young adult and military life. Part 3 covered his romance and partnership with Meghan and his split from his official royal duties.After being harassed and terrorized by the press for decades (often seemingly with the support of palace staffers and ""insiders"") this book is Harry's opportunity to tell his side of the story and address any and all rumors published about him over the last few decades. Harry doesn't ""spare"" any of his naked truths (including the notorious Vegas nudes), no matter how much they may play into his reputation as a party boy and I appreciated his candidness - it definitely made him super relateable. He also acknowledged his privilege and never tried to pretend to be anything other than who he was and I respected that.I didn't really find this book to be as juicy or scandalous as many on social media led me to expect. Yes, Harry smokes weed and has experimented with other drugs... so what? I'm sure he's not the only Royal to do this/have done this - the difference is thst he is honest and open about it. The ""shocking"" bits about Courtney Cox weren't shocking at all. He spoke of ex-girlfriends with tenderness and empathy. And above all else, he spoke with love and affection for his family and limited any (well-deserved) criticism to the very end of the book. This book got me deep in the feels in so many places and had me ugly crying a few times. I was impressed with how openly Harry spoke of his struggle with PTSD and experience with therapy. I was also inspired by his military service, his love for his fellow soldiers and wounded warriors in Britain, Canada AND the U.S. I was also greatly moved by his love for Africa and conservation. Finally, the love between Harry and Meghan is so beautiful - they both gave up everything in their past lives to be together.The book also had me fascinated by the royal family - As an American, I was a huge fan of Diana's when I was young and I was glued to the t.v. for the most recent royal weddings, but otherwise, I didn't really pay much thought to the royals. I also never really thought about the fact that the current royal family is actually descended from notorious historical figures like Henry VIII. When Harry discusses his teacher's unhappiness at his lack of knowledge about British history, given that the people they were studying were his blood relatives (lmao), I actually found a British Royal Family Tree online and referenced it several times while reading the book.Overall, Spare left me with so much empathy and admiration for Prince Harry as a man, husband, father, soldier, conservationist and human being.Content Warnings: Loss Of Parent, Wartime Activities, PTSD, Depression, Suicide and Suicide Ideation, Animal Cruelty, Racism, Bullying, StalkingShow more",5,Once upon a time there was a girl from LA Some people called her an actress And there was a guy from London Some people called him a prince All of those people didnt fully get it Because this is the love story of a boy and a girl who were meant to be together  Meghan MarklePrince Harrys Spare was so much more than I expected It was heartbreaking touching funny and candid By the time I read this book Id already seen the Oprah interview and watched the Netflix documentary but this book provided such beautiful colorful painful and raw insight into Harrys life and demonstrated that despite being born into one of the most powerful families in the world at the end of the day he is as human flawed and broken as the rest of us I understand the book was written by a ghostwriter but it so perfectly captured his style voice and truth that despite reading the print version I could literally hear Harry speaking some parts of the book in my mind Finishing this book feels like parting ways with a dear friendThe structure of the book flowed seamlessly Part 1 covered Harrys tween and teen years following the loss of his beloved mother Part 2 covered his young adult and military life Part 3 covered his romance and partnership with Meghan and his split from his official royal dutiesAfter being harassed and terrorized by the press for decades often seemingly with the support of palace staffers and insiders this book is Harrys opportunity to tell his side of the story and address any and all rumors published about him over the last few decades Harry doesnt spare any of his naked truths including the notorious Vegas nudes no matter how much they may play into his reputation as a party boy and I appreciated his candidness  it definitely made him super relateable He also acknowledged his privilege and never tried to pretend to be anything other than who he was and I respected thatI didnt really find this book to be as juicy or scandalous as many on social media led me to expect Yes Harry smokes weed and has experimented with other drugs so what Im sure hes not the only Royal to do thishave done this  the difference is thst he is honest and open about it The shocking bits about Courtney Cox werent shocking at all He spoke of exgirlfriends with tenderness and empathy And above all else he spoke with love and affection for his family and limited any welldeserved criticism to the very end of the book This book got me deep in the feels in so many places and had me ugly crying a few times I was impressed with how openly Harry spoke of his struggle with PTSD and experience with therapy I was also inspired by his military service his love for his fellow soldiers and wounded warriors in Britain Canada AND the US I was also greatly moved by his love for Africa and conservation Finally the love between Harry and Meghan is so beautiful  they both gave up everything in their past lives to be togetherThe book also had me fascinated by the royal family  As an American I was a huge fan of Dianas when I was young and I was glued to the tv for the most recent royal weddings but otherwise I didnt really pay much thought to the royals I also never really thought about the fact that the current royal family is actually descended from notorious historical figures like Henry VIII When Harry discusses his teachers unhappiness at his lack of knowledge about British history given that the people they were studying were his blood relatives lmao I actually found a British Royal Family Tree online and referenced it several times while reading the bookOverall Spare left me with so much empathy and admiration for Prince Harry as a man husband father soldier conservationist and human beingContent Warnings Loss Of Parent Wartime Activities PTSD Depression Suicide and Suicide Ideation Animal Cruelty Racism Bullying StalkingShow more
Rating 2 out of 5,"Giving this one extra star (for a total of two stars) because let’s face it, Harry was born into this life so I get that it’s hard for him to think critically beyond the monarchy as he’s always known it. I began this book with almost no opinions about the monarchy and definitely feel like this book had the chance to push me in either direction. It was terrible. Harry is the most self-centered and self-congratulatory narrator whose memoir I’ve ever read, and he does it while thinking he’s self-aware the whole time. Amazing! I don’t think we need to do a full breakdown of all of the absurd moments in this book but I will list my personal highlights anyway (listing every ex girlfriend, falling in love with MM via instagram story of her with the dog ears/tongue filter, the constant mentions of his penis, his weird and never fully investigated relationship with Africa, the constant casual mentions of ways he is normal — he sometimes does his own laundry!, the INFURIATING SENTENCE FRAGMENTS) All of this honestly contributed to my second star and made it fun to read. There were two main gripes I had with Harry when reading this:1. He only cares about issues when they directly impact him. Racism — not a problem until it affects him. The press — not a problem until it affects him. (Or those in his world). 2. He still supports the monarchy even after all of this, which makes me think he’s nowhere close to having thought more critically about it. The hostile relationship between the press and the monarchy is how both of those businesses stay afloat! How does he envision the monarchy existing where it still “benefits” the UK (which I think we can agree it does not) when this relationship is civil and collaborative? Part 1 is okay, part 2 is an absolute slog, part 3 is slightly redeeming 2 stars also I have the eBook if anyone wants it so we don't support the Harry Industrial ComplexShow more",2,Giving this one extra star for a total of two stars because lets face it Harry was born into this life so I get that its hard for him to think critically beyond the monarchy as hes always known it I began this book with almost no opinions about the monarchy and definitely feel like this book had the chance to push me in either direction It was terrible Harry is the most selfcentered and selfcongratulatory narrator whose memoir Ive ever read and he does it while thinking hes selfaware the whole time Amazing I dont think we need to do a full breakdown of all of the absurd moments in this book but I will list my personal highlights anyway listing every ex girlfriend falling in love with MM via instagram story of her with the dog earstongue filter the constant mentions of his penis his weird and never fully investigated relationship with Africa the constant casual mentions of ways he is normal  he sometimes does his own laundry the INFURIATING SENTENCE FRAGMENTS All of this honestly contributed to my second star and made it fun to read There were two main gripes I had with Harry when reading this1 He only cares about issues when they directly impact him Racism  not a problem until it affects him The press  not a problem until it affects him Or those in his world 2 He still supports the monarchy even after all of this which makes me think hes nowhere close to having thought more critically about it The hostile relationship between the press and the monarchy is how both of those businesses stay afloat How does he envision the monarchy existing where it still benefits the UK which I think we can agree it does not when this relationship is civil and collaborative Part 1 is okay part 2 is an absolute slog part 3 is slightly redeeming 2 stars also I have the eBook if anyone wants it so we dont support the Harry Industrial ComplexShow more
Rating 5 out of 5,"✨ REVIEW: Spare by Prince Harry. Thank you, Random House, for the gifted copy of this book. {partner}Genre: Non-FictionFormat: 🎧Pub Date: 1.10.2023Star Rating: ☆☆☆☆☆""No one had an answer for a boy seeking external pain to match his internal."" 👆🏼this quote sums up so many things about Spare. As soon as I saw that Prince Harry was publishing a book about his life AND would be narrating the audio, I knew I had to listen. I'm so glad I could hear him tell his story in his voice. It was a beautifully written and deeply personal look into the life of one of the former senior members of the royal family. While Harry does discuss what led to his inevitable split from his family, it's not the sole focus. It's more about his life in and out of the public eye. Harry is a human being. He has made mistakes, as we all have, and boy, am I glad my 20-year-old self didn't have her mistakes featured on the front page of magazines, newspapers, and talk shows. Harry made mistakes and was left to face them alone without any real support. The chapters of him discussing his mother's death brought me to tears because I could hear, in his voice, that he still carries so much of that with him to this day. Spare also made me realize how deeply toxic the royal family's relationship is with the press. I actually can't quite wrap my mind around all the ways that they are intertwined. I have always liked Harry, but reading his book made me deeply appreciate him and his courage to stand up for himself, his wife, and his children.

Rating 5 out of 5,"Would I recommend this book - yes.It’s a controversial one, but I figured after the first few chapters that I would like this.I am obviously neither a moral nor a truth police, nor do I have any authority to really judge the genuiness of the book, but it did feel sincere. Above all, it’s not a gossip book. Throughout the book I never had the feeling that he would have crossed lines, he also never spoke about the private lives of his family members unless within situations that involved him. Thus, while I cannot be sure, the book did make me trust his version of the events and made me see his view of the events. It didn’t always excuse, but it did explain. His childhood, adolescence and grown-up life in front of the media seemed absolutely horrible to say the least. The media and paparazzi were relentless (this is something I think even as bystanders we can agree with) and I cannot imagine having to live this life. I cannot imagine being told one day that you’re being cut off from family funds, if that same family has never allowed you to work a day in your life or try to make your own money. I cannot imagine not being able to fully trust your friends and family.I do not believe that royal family is a holy entity, whose inner workings cannot be shed light on. As a public I feel we sometimes buy into the “never complain never explain” mentality of the royal family and therefore get mad when someone wants to come forward and talk about their experience. “He shouldn’t talk about private matters” - ok, but why not? Isn’t this something we all do, something that media does, something that books are constantly being written about? Why do people suddenly find this so completely unacceptable when it comes to royalty, that they go on another witch hunt for a man that didn’t choose this life, but was born into it and suffered? A golden cage is still a cage. All in all, 5 stars from me and I sincerely wish them all the best.Show more",5,Would I recommend this book  yesIts a controversial one but I figured after the first few chapters that I would like thisI am obviously neither a moral nor a truth police nor do I have any authority to really judge the genuiness of the book but it did feel sincere Above all its not a gossip book Throughout the book I never had the feeling that he would have crossed lines he also never spoke about the private lives of his family members unless within situations that involved him Thus while I cannot be sure the book did make me trust his version of the events and made me see his view of the events It didnt always excuse but it did explain His childhood adolescence and grownup life in front of the media seemed absolutely horrible to say the least The media and paparazzi were relentless this is something I think even as bystanders we can agree with and I cannot imagine having to live this life I cannot imagine being told one day that youre being cut off from family funds if that same family has never allowed you to work a day in your life or try to make your own money I cannot imagine not being able to fully trust your friends and familyI do not believe that royal family is a holy entity whose inner workings cannot be shed light on As a public I feel we sometimes buy into the never complain never explain mentality of the royal family and therefore get mad when someone wants to come forward and talk about their experience He shouldnt talk about private matters  ok but why not Isnt this something we all do something that media does something that books are constantly being written about Why do people suddenly find this so completely unacceptable when it comes to royalty that they go on another witch hunt for a man that didnt choose this life but was born into it and suffered A golden cage is still a cage All in all 5 stars from me and I sincerely wish them all the bestShow more

Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 starsI know everyone is probably sick of seeing posts about 𝗦𝗣𝗔𝗥𝗘, so I’ll try to keep mine concise. I’m not a person who has strong feelings one way or the other about the British Monarchy. It’s their thing, not ours. However, I was curious enough about Prince Harry’s memoir to put in a @libby.app hold way back when and I got a copy the day it was released. Overall, I liked it.

Rating 4 out of 5,"This is not really an easy book to review. It's controversial for obvious reasons; there's been much public controversy around Harry and Meghan, and those who aren't for them, are sometimes quite vitriolic. Even those who aren't vitriolic tend to treat all criticisms and condemnations of the pair as being true because after all, it's Harry and Meghan, and obviously it's them, not Will & Kate, the officially charming heir and wife, now officially Prince and Princess of Wales. And anything that's bad for Harry, well, he should be used to it because royalty, Will's the heir, Harry's the spare, so obviously if he's unhappy he's just resenting his place in the family. Or Meghan is pushing him to, despite the fact that he was obviously unhappy with both the public role and extreme limitations on what he could do. Not a desire to go out clubbing more; a desire to do things he was actually good at--like being a soldier.Reading about Harry's school years, I wondered whether he'd ever been tested for neurodivergence or other things that might be called ""learning disorders."" Stupid people don't become very good military pilots. People who have developmental issues that make learning from books and lectures difficult potentially can. But of course the answer is that he wouldn't have been tested. In the rigid and outdated worldview of the Royal Family and those who surround them, a diagnosed neurodivergence or learning disability would have been viewed as far worse than merely being ""not the smart one."" Particularly since he was not the heir, but just the spare.Some stories that have been cited as clear evidence of Will and Harry being treated differently have been dismissed as ""William's going to be king someday; Harry isn't."" In many cases that's valid. The chances of the second son ever being king were always low, and they dropped lower, not just when William actually got married, but when he was nearing adulthood, alive and healthy. They were being prepared for different lives. Some differences were not just appropriate, but necessary.But some of them were just differences that said to two young children that one of them didn't matter.Yet the real problem may have been the way they were treated ""the same,"" when that was for looks rather than what was good for the two of them. Eton wasn't academically a good fit for Harry, and William was at the age where you don't want to be embarrassed by your younger sibling. Yet it was judged essential for both boys to go to Eton--where William told Harry they officially didn't know each other, Harry struggled academically, and Harry acted out in, actually fairly normal, rule-breaking and pranks, that the son of the Prince of Wales couldn't get caught in.Harry doesn't so much talk about his mother's death, but his blocking out the grief he's afraid to experience by convincing himself it's all an elaborate trick, his Mummy disappearing to escape the way the media treated her. He held on to this idea, and didn't confront and process his grief, until a visit to Paris as an adult, when he went to the tunnel where she had her fatal accident.It's after Eton that we start to see the nearly adult Harry, as he takes a gap year, originally on a cattle ranch (station?) in Australia. It's a good experience for him, doing hard, physical work every day, regular chores, eating with the family, and not being in the public eye.Until the paparazzi find him, and create not just distraction, but potential danger for the ranch and the cattle with their happy disregard for anything except getting the pictures they wanted. Harry has to leave, and instead goes to Africa--where he makes connections that became very important to him in the years to come.In the following years, he enlists in the army, starts training as a pilot, has his first serious girlfriends--relationships that end, when the women find they, and their families, can't endure the paparazzi whose constant pursuit that Harry already hates. And no, it's not okay because he's a royal. It's utterly nonsensical to say on the one hand that he has no reason to complain about anything because he's so privileged, and on the other hand he's so low in the line of succession that he's a nobody who shouldn't expect anything at all, including being able to serve in a combat zone as a regular soldier, without becoming an additional threat to his fellow soldiers because of the mindless pursuit of the media. He becomes a very good pilot, and is deployed to Afghanistan, where he does very well as an FAC--a Forward Air Commander--until, of course, the media catch up with him.He gets pulled out, of course, and it takes him quite a long time to jump through all the hoops needed to get back there (while not being able to do anything else worthwhile in the meantime). He manages it eventually, and is again doing very well there, when a media party comes through, and he's ordered to cooperate with them. They promise to keep his location secret, and they of course don't, and he's pulled out again, and it's the end of his military career.It's late in the book that he meets Meghan Markle, and this of course is wildly controversial the moment it becomes public knowledge.No, Meghan wasn't treated just like Kate, or Camilla, or even Diana. There's too much to say, so I'll limit myself to just pointing out that none of the others were featured in a photoshopped picture, walking with William or Charles, holding hands with a toddler chimpanzee. That was vile, that was inexcusable, and anyone who claims not to believe that Meghan was at one point suicidal in the face of the viciousness and malevolence of the coverage she was subjected to, was, to be charitable, not paying attention.But also, anyone who thinks Harry was ever happy as part of the Royal Family ""firm,"" wasn't paying attention, either. Nor was the reason for his unhappiness that he was ""lazy."" It's one thing to say he was born into the job, but you're allowed to quit jobs, even the family business.Harry has a great deal to say about his own mistakes, his sometimes questionable behavior (which, depending on your views, may include his use of marijuana and sometimes hallucinogenic mushrooms), and his mental health struggles. There's also a fair amount about what look like very odd family dynamics. For me, this includes the fact that William and Charles call Harry--whose given name is Henry--""Harold."" Why? Harry never says or says anything to suggest he thinks it's odd. Which suggests there might be a reason he got that nickname, and I went to Google...All I found was a suggestion that it's because William the Conqueror was the first King William of England, and he became King of England by defeating and killing Harold Godwinson (Harold II of England).If that's true, it's beyond odd. It's downright unhealthy. But it's only a story on the internet, without great sourcing. I wouldn't even consider it, if I had found anything else at all. Yet the sourcing remains so vague that still I can only roll my eyes at it.If anyone reading this has a better explanation, I want to hear it. Really. Please give me something more plausible if you can.We do follow Harry and Meghan through their courtship and marriage, with all the weirdness of what's okay for them to do and what isn't, and the media's vicious descent on Meghan. The book ends with them living in the US, and the birth of their second child, Lilibet. Harry certainly doesn't make it sound as if they will ever move back to the UK, which will outrage all the same people who hate them.This is an insightful and moving book. Harry has given a lot of thought to things, and is open and vulnerable, and well worth reading.I bought this book.Show more",4,This is not really an easy book to review Its controversial for obvious

Rating 2 out of 5,"I won't make any big statements about the British monarchy but I will say this: If being in line for the throne was based on any sort of credentials, I can't imagine Harry being 4th in line. Review to come cause in 2023, we write reviews but for now, here are some Korea predictions cause hey, I'm leaving soon and this will be fun to look at:  - I’ve lived with international students for several years which makes me a self proclaimed expert in dumb things foreigners say. For my time in Korea, it is my ultimate goal to avoid being them. I want to remember that no matter how much I might study about Korean history, culture and politics, I will never have the same experiences and knowledge as a Korean. I don’t know what it means to walk on this earth as a Korean. There are entire worlds that are shut off from me. I��m not going to be the foreigner that says “well, in my country…” unprompted. - And while I’m sure I’ll have opinions, sooner or later, I want to always question myself and my biases. As an outsider, it’s always going to be easy to generalize about the in-group and I’m not having that. I can’t let myself go, “oh, this is because Koreans are….”. - And I want to remember that there are probably Koreans working towards solving every problem I see. I won’t know the local Korean activist scene but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. - But anyways, I’m so so excited. I’ve wanted to do this for so long. - In Taiwan, people often referred to me as Western which was funny cause next to my European friends, I’m always feeling un-Western (”why yes, religion makes the rules here”). I wonder if this will be similar, will I end up owning the Western energy? Coming from Norway to Korea is probably going to add to that sense of confusion, like I'm definitely not going to feel Western in Norway.  - I want to get my life together and hike more. Korea is really beautiful and hopefully, my low number of uni credits means I’ll have that time. There’s a version of me that’s very nature-loving and I am going to find them. - I’m curious as to whether foreigners actually experience discrimination. The internet seems to have mixed opinions, particular those of us who are white-passing. - Last time I left for a long time, I didn’t have any sense of responsibility. It was easy to simply disappear for a year, to firmly believe that everyone in my life will be fine. Now, it’s much much harder. I have learned that life goes on when you’re not there. My grandparents will get older. My parents will get older. My siblings will grow. I am terrified of something going wrong when I will be 15 hours away. - I’ve gone from not knowing I get a scholarship to complaining that the scholarship is too low remarkably fast. Shamefully fast. - Israel is one of the least hierarchical countries and my understanding is that Korea is very much hierarchical. I wonder what that will be like- I’ve never called a professor by anything other than their first name, for example. Heck, I’ve never called anyone anything other than their first name. The idea that someone deserves more respect because of their title is baffling, but maybe it’ll be easier for me to accept in Korea? - I’ll encounter tough moments. However, I have discovered that when you are alone, you find strength that you didn’t know existed. - Seoul seems to have a great art scene, I hope I’ll find my way into that. I fully intend on visiting as many art galleries as humanely possible. - Korea and Israel both have mandatory army service but I’m fascinated by the differences. My army service was long coffee breaks, jokes about the army and very little work. It was saying, “fuck the army” and having people around me nod. I hung pride flags in my army office and lectured to my base about the lgbt+ community. The Israeli army teaches you to mock authority, to belittle big systems, to follow your intuitions over some hierarchy. Korea does not seem to be the same. - I’ve never studied a language like Korean so I’m keeping my expectations low- if I get to a point where I can say, “hi, how are you doing? I’m lost. I’m vegetarian so no meat, pork, fish or chicken, what do you recommend? thanks! have a great day!”, I’ll be content with my Korean skills. - Okay, that’s not true- I wanna know how to read. I also want to be able to eavesdrop to conversations around me. In some ways, this is an intriguing language learning experience because I can fully immerse myself. At the same time, it is so unlike anything I know. I can’t rely on Hebrew or English to help. - I’m sure I’ll feel deeply lonely at times. It’ll hurt, especially seeing that I’m going to miss my graduation (yeah lol, i might never get my degree cause do we really trust the mail? might never get a graduation pic, oops) as well as pride parade (which hurts, ngl) - Seoul is so so big, I am so excited to spend time exploring it. Like heck yes, putting time aside to just randomly picking areas and roaming around. I love massive cities so much, this is going to be so much fun. Give me that public transport, endless streets, lots of noise, cozy corners. - And it has a river! I've never lived in a city with a river!  - I've never been into kpop or kdramas. I don't know anything. I wonder if this will change.  - I’m anxious about many parts: renting a place, getting an ARC, the visa process, finding my way in the university, culture shock, finding the right kind of friends (or, I feel I have become quirkier than I was last time I traveled), ahh.  - There are several falafel places, I am definitely going to end up hanging around the Muslim community just for the Middle East vibes. If someone isn’t shouting at me, if food isn’t drenched in olive oil, if I don’t see enough religious people, I do not feel at home. And while halal food isn’t kosher, it is a relief to know there’s no pork. Accidentally eating pork would be catastrophic, I will seriously panic. I genuinely am not sure what I’d do if I accidentally ate pork (or any other very non-kosher meat like oh my god, no shame towards Koreans but sea food scares me) - I saw several comments on how South Korea is stressful because of North Korea but like, I’m Israeli. Iran has a literal clock to Israel’s destruction and if they don’t threaten to nuke us once a week, I get concerned about them. And yet, I also wonder if I’ll be able to have conversations about this. My phase of reading about North Korea ended but I still would love to learn more, especially about the feeling of peoplehood. I expect Koreans to be very chill about this as the conflict isn’t bloody, wonder if that's true.  - I’m very far from the Korean beauty standards but I’m also (finally!) really comfortable with myself and my body. I wonder if I’ll feel anything or if anyone will make me feel anything. I don’t see me comparing myself to anyone and let’s be honest, I’m really proud of my fairly Jewish nose but still, I realize these are things you can feel through the messages in the society. I’m also very stubborn about opposing beauty standards so I’m curious if that’s a conversation I’ll end up having. - I don’t intend to study. Like come on, I’m on vacation. I realize Korea has an intense work culture but nope. Not me. - Apparently, Koreans have the perception that all Jews are very smart, to the point where there’s an argument if they’re very antisemitic or just philosemitic. This probably has to do with the fact that there’s virtually no Jewish community. People who believe Jews are smart clearly haven’t ever witnessed Israel’s driving culture. South Korea is also considered the most antisemitic country in Asia (putting aside MENA) due to this. So I wonder what it’ll be like, if that’s something I’ll encounter in any way. I am not very good at dealing with antisemitism but also all it takes to realize Jews aren’t smart is to ask me to do some basic math. - I’m so excited to meet the local queer community. I’m so sure they’re going to be lovely. I hope I find them. - The lack of Jewish community is stressful, just a bit. I worry mostly about Shabbat (and Passover, oh dear, gotta find a seder host (or do my own, that would actually be kind of cool, like imagine inviting the friends I should theoretically have at that point to join me in a seder- I’d even consider doing the Hagaddah in English for that)). I’ll reach out to Chabad, of course, but I’m also not sure how I’ll sustain my Jewish practices or how other people will view it. Like, “enjoy your intense work culture, if you’ll excuse me, my culture mandates I take a 25 hour break”. - I’m somewhat of a grumpy old uncle at this point of my life- I don't like loud parties, I have no intention of getting drunk, I am willing to go dancing twice (2) a year. I would like to be able to stay true to my preferences but also be open to new experiences. I hope this works out, especially as I feel I'll be old compared to all the 18 year olds.

Review to come cause in 2023 we write reviews but for now here are some Korea predictions cause hey Im leaving soon and this will be fun to look at   Ive lived with international students for several years which makes me a self proclaimed expert in dumb things foreigners say For my time in Korea it is my ultimate goal to avoid being them I want to remember that no matter how much I might study about Korean history culture and politics I will never have the same experiences and knowledge as a Korean I dont know what it means to walk on this earth as a Korean There are entire worlds that are shut off from me Im not going to be the foreigner that says well in my country unprompted  And while Im sure Ill have opinions sooner or later I want to always question myself and my biases As an outsider its always going to be easy to generalize about the ingroup and Im not having that I cant let myself go oh this is because Koreans are  And I want to remember that there are probably Koreans working towards solving every problem I see I wont know the local Korean activist scene but that doesnt mean it doesnt exist  But anyways Im so so excited Ive wanted to do this for so long  In Taiwan people often referred to me as Western which was funny cause next to my European friends Im always feeling unWestern why yes religion makes the rules here I wonder if this will be similar will I end up owning the Western energy Coming from Norway to Korea is probably going to add to that sense of confusion like Im definitely not going to feel Western in Norway   I want to get my life together and hike more Korea is really beautiful and hopefully my low number of uni credits means Ill have that time Theres a version of me thats very natureloving and I am going to find them  Im curious as to whether foreigners actually experience discrimination The internet seems to have mixed opinions particular those of us who are whitepassing  Last time I left for a long time I didnt have any sense of responsibility It was easy to simply disappear for a year to firmly believe that everyone in my life will be fine Now its much much harder I have learned that life goes on when youre not there My grandparents will get older My parents will get older My siblings will grow I am terrified of something going wrong when I will be 15 hours away  Ive gone from not knowing I get a scholarship to complaining that the scholarship is too low remarkably fast Shamefully fast  Israel is one of the least hierarchical countries and my understanding is that Korea is very much hierarchical I wonder what that will be like Ive never called a professor by anything other than their first name for example Heck Ive never called anyone anything other than their first name The idea that someone deserves more respect because of their title is baffling but maybe itll be easier for me to accept in Korea  Ill encounter tough moments However I have discovered that when you are alone you find strength that you didnt know existed  Seoul seems to have a great art scene I hope Ill find my way into that I fully intend on visiting as many art galleries as humanely possible  Korea and Israel both have mandatory army service but Im fascinated by the differences My army service was long coffee breaks jokes about the army and very little work It was saying fuck the army and having people around me nod I hung pride flags in my army office and lectured to my base about the lgbt community The Israeli army teaches you to mock authority to belittle big systems to follow your intuitions over some hierarchy Korea does not seem to be the same  Ive never studied a language like Korean so Im keeping my expectations low if I get to a point where I can say hi how are you doing Im lost Im vegetarian so no meat pork fish or chicken what do you recommend thanks have a great day Ill be content with my Korean skills  Okay thats not true I wanna know how to read I also want to be able to eavesdrop to conversations around me In some ways this is an intriguing language learning experience because I can fully immerse myself At the same time it is so unlike anything I know I cant rely on Hebrew or English to help  Im sure Ill feel deeply lonely at times Itll hurt especially seeing that Im going to miss my graduation yeah lol i might never get my degree cause do we really trust the mail might never get a graduation pic oops as well as pride parade which hurts ngl  Seoul is so so big I am so excited to spend time exploring it Like heck yes putting time aside to just randomly picking areas and roaming around I love massive cities so much this is going to be so much fun Give me that public transport endless streets lots of noise cozy corners  And it has a river Ive never lived in a city with a river   Ive never been into kpop or kdramas I dont know anything I wonder if this will change   Im anxious about many parts renting a place getting an ARC the visa process finding my way in the university culture shock finding the right kind of friends or I feel I have become quirkier than I was last time I traveled ahh   There are several falafel places I am definitely going to end up hanging around the Muslim community just for the Middle East vibes If someone isnt shouting at me if food isnt drenched in olive oil if I dont see enough religious people I do not feel at home And while halal food isnt kosher it is a relief to know theres no pork Accidentally eating pork would be catastrophic I will seriously panic I genuinely am not sure what Id do if I accidentally ate pork or any other very nonkosher meat like oh my god no shame towards Koreans but sea food scares me  I saw several comments on how South Korea is stressful because of North Korea but like Im Israeli Iran has a literal clock to Israels destruction and if they dont threaten to nuke us once a week I get concerned about them And yet I also wonder if Ill be able to have conversations about this My phase of

Rating 3 out of 5,"I wasn't going to read this, but the vitriol in the 'reviews' has changed my mind. It might be an important topic with a lot of nuance to it. It's interesting: one can have compassion and support someone who left their abusive family *and* talk about the evils of privilege and colonialism at the same time. But the way the tabloids drew so many people in to hate is not nuanced at all. That was and always will be trash.////Now that I've read it, I have a lot of thoughts!But no one wants to hear a prince argue for the existence of a monarchy, any more than they want to hear a prince argue against it - this quote feels like a perfect distillation of what the book is, a memoir where the only real stand taken is the one on the tabloids (which is very warranted, on my opinion). But other than that, the man I'm affectionately calling Prince Himbo seems to constantly stumble into interesting and challenging ideas and then proceeds to wave them away. + This whole memoir seems to be just a way for Harry to tell his own story, and to just take all the lies and misinterpreted moments that were blown up in the tabloids and set the record straight (from his perspective). I totally get that. It seems that he asked his family to protect him and let him tell the truth in the media for a long time before Megan showed up and he wasn't allowed to do that, and it is his right to do so. Beyond the complexities of the situation, the tabloids are completely fucked up and that's a fact. And they've done a lot of harm against him and his family. - On the minus side, he seems to think that the tabloids are the only reason his family is the way it is and that could not be true. + As someone who was rejected by her family in various ways, over and over again, I have a vibe like there's a big part of Harry trying to get them to understand his side, and so the memoir would be that: I am here, look at me, understand me, love me. That makes me feel sad, I totally get it. Who doesn't fantasize about their family finally seeing them? + I was kind of excited to read this because of all the tidbits about his family that were on Twitter or in the media. But let me explain. A lot of this situation seems to have happened because of the performance of monarchy, keeping an image of the institution as pristine and super polished. And something felt transgressive and exciting about pulling back the curtain and seeing them as people, with real bodies, with the same gross and undignified bodily processes we all have. Want to have an image in your head of Charles exercising in his underwear? Want to think about Harry's 'todger'? (You are a grown man, use the word penis!) I liked how the book demystified a lot of how the royal family works, the moments with Harry drying his laundry on his radiator and having anxiety and watching Friends felt like a surprise and eminently relatable. - Sure, he reveals a bunch of intimate details about the family and there is an ethical question there, but at the same time, he doesn't really engage with actual serious stuff! Like Prince Andrew is mentioned maybe twice. 'He was embroiled in a shameful scandal, accused of the sexual assault of a young woman and no one had so much suggested that he lose his security'. (She was a girl! She was a minor, come on PH!) - this was at 77% and was the biggest mention, the first one was at 71% and was very neutral (Megan asked who that guy was). That seems like a glaring omission. He doesn't seem to have a sweeping perspective of the monarchy and how systems work. Ne never talks about fucking tories and their policies, it's all so subdued. There is maybe one mention of colonialism, in the beginning, when he was a kid, and that's it! And still he acts as a savior for the charities, a savior for Africa. -The military part was such a slog to go through. He describes with awareness and accuracy how boot camp basically reprograms your brain and then he proceeds to love it, because he felt lost in his life and this gave him structure in a hierarchy ('Sunder yourself from your self. The color sergeants said this was part of their Grand Plan. Kill the Self. Then we'd all be on the same page. Then we'd truly be One Unit. As the primacy of Self fades, they promised, the idea of Self takes over. Platoon, country, that'll be all you know, cadets. (...) I loved them for it. At night, before blacking out, I gave thanks'). He has a very black and white view of the two sides of the conflict and lacking completely in nuance and historical facts. (Like what the British did in Afghanistan more than a hundred years earlier). There is a lot of cognitive dissonance about a lot of topics and a lot of stuff he doesn't know and hasn't interrogated. + On the emotional side, I empathized a lot. It feels like the relationship with his family, his grief that nobody helped him with was drawn quite well and in a moving way. There is a thematic thread of death that goes through this whole book. He was so lonely and I felt that. Despite his uninvestigated privileges, he did go through a lot of stuff emotionally. - There's a tantalizing train of thought at some point when he says that the monarchy is built on marriages and how that legitimizes you, but he, as usual, doesn't go much further with it and just reaches the conclusion that he wants to get married, maybe he'll be more accepted then. I eye rolled so hard. +I loved the little bits of magical thinking - the psychic, the message from his mother in the form of an xmas tree ornament, the connecting with the fox. I always enjoy stuff like that. As a conclusion, I guess it feels to me like he has a lot to learn about the world, but since he's still privileged, I don't know if the motivation will be there for that to happen. I imagine that this book is authentic, but also that a lot of his world view didn't make it into this. I'm glad he decided to give himself agency at some point, because he had been trapped in that toxic environment for decades, coddled and at the same time infantilized, like he says. I have no idea why so many people (even in Romania, damn, I've seen some horrible conversations on social media) are defending the monarchy so vehemently. It is just an empty symbol, it wouldn't exist without the millions of people who believe in it and give it the soft power it has. I've seen how many people take it for granted, as a 'real' thing they should defend and invest time in. The vitriol at Harry and Megan really shocked me, it still does, that's why I read this book. But hey! It is super ok to leave your family if they're toxic. It is super ok to set boundaries with them and have your own life. It's actually advisable to save yourself and make your own path, as good and happy as you can make it.Show more",3,I wasnt going to read this but the vitriol in the reviews has changed my mind It

Rating 4 out of 5,"“Prince Harry is a lil B—“ my brother’s text to me, representative of thousands’ POV. Methinks that is indicative of the media’s taint and bias.For me this memoir was a fine 4.3!!! Delight to read. And about the Henry VI error—- the guy has all along said he is not very bright or intelligent. He admitted he didn’t do well at Eton. But I’m tired of the merciless spirit from the public of “man— that idiot Prince Harry— he’s messed up yet again. Sigh “- I’m sighing bc the greater effort of this book,to empathize a wee bit from his perspective, his observations and feelings, his feeling inadequate and not good enough his entire life.I’ve made comments while reading the memoir— and I need more time to ruminate…. But this is definitely well-written. The nature observations and the last imagery of the wounded hummingbird, Dillard would approve!This for sure—- now I want to watch The Tender Bar, and his ghostwriter (Moehringer) intrigues me!Best parts of this memoir are the delicious courtship and romance , Africa bits and explanation of matters in Brit order and culture that are not mucked up by airing dirty laundry and revenge gossip, cringeworthy portions of pettiness and deep hurt and anger. He certainly is justifying it by saying they did it first, just hiding behind the rota. Those parts were skip worthy for me.But aye, eye-opening, the super perverse relationship between the Royal Rota and the House of Windsor— in other words, they’re just a bunch of inauthentic, rich prisoners, whereby DNA is worshipped and character content can be manipulated by media at will.And lastly, do I believe him? I do.PS Soho House memberships start at $180USD… the place where cholera all started!PPS I also have a mega-bias listening to this——1. I Suits fan 2.

Rating 4 out of 5,"I wanted to hate this book. I wanted to find its tone whiney, self-focused, and entitled--something like the memoir equivalent of a man cold. I'm not sure why, maybe my childhood crush on and bizarre sense of identification with Prince William (I, too, often feel the weight of being the oldest child). In any case, my hopes of hating this memoir were squelched almost immediately. I'm glad I read this book.First off, I'll concede: the memoir is hardly 'perfect' (what book is?). --> Were there a number of factual inaccuracies? Yes (e.g. Harry was not related to Henry VI), but all of them (that I noticed, anyway) seem inadvertent, neither malevolent nor self-aggrandizing. Even the best books contain errors and editorial gaffes. Because of the level of scrutiny this book has received early on, these errors have become apparent more quickly than they would have in a similar book.--> Was it long? Yes, but purposefully so. What makes it long is not endless whining, as so much of the media (and ignorant comments on social media) have portrayed. This is not the endless drivel of a man complaining on and on about his life. I found the writing to be compelling, self-aware, and an honest attempt to come to terms not only with his life, but with his own self--his failings, his shortcomings, his complicity in many of the problems he points out. The trajectory of the book was solid and well composed--compelling themes and symbolism were woven in and out across the whole work. The chapters flowed, and in general, I could not put the book down (I finished the entire 15-hr audio version, read by Prince Harry himself, within 4-5 days). The book benefitted from being ghostwritten by acclaimed novelist J. R. Moehringer (which H publicly disclosed in the early stages of producing his memoir, back in 2021), and the effect is a thoroughly well-constructed, almost literary quality memoir.--> Are there outrageous claims? Yes, but most of them are verifiable, and many of them have already been acknowledged by members of the media. What isn't verifiable is in the normal realm of memoir writing--the author's memories, emotions, etc. Was everything in his description of family dynamics objectively true in an absolute sense? Probably not. Probably, like any other human effort to tell a story, there are two sides and the truth lies somewhere in between. But if even a fraction of what he has said is true in any authoritative way, then holy hell. There's a serious problem with what the British press and others have been able to get away with. --> While this book take down the monarchy? Not likely, and that's not Prince Harry's purpose. I was caught off guard by how faithful and loving he was towards the Queen and the monarchy as an institution. He is simply holding the monarchy to a higher, and more humanizing standard--and striving to do so, out of fidelity and love.Now that I've read the book in its entirety, I can see that virtually every negative review or comment I've read on the internet about it has been written either by someone who hasn't actually read the work, or who has only read it enough to take a few stray quotes out of context and misrepresent the entire book. An example of this: everyone keeps mentioning the ""frozen todger"" bit, as though to suggest how shameless and petulant Harry must be for talking about his penis getting frosbitten while on an expedition to the Arctic. If you read the full section, though, it's pretty clear that although he's a bit tongue-in-cheek for a line or two, his reason for including this anecdote was to illustrate a bigger painpoint in his life. He was trying to show how difficult it can be, when you are so hunted by the media that virtually anyone can be bought off (even medical professionals), to get help for such a sensitive and intimate health issue. (I can identify with this, since I would rather drive a rusted nail slowly into my eyeball than see a doctor for a problem ""down there,"" and I don't have photographers tracking my every move.) Harry put off seeing a doctor despite excruciating pain, hoping the problem would resolve itself. When it didn't--when he was in constant pain and could barely even pee anymore--he was forced to go to a clinic and nearly had a panic attack about it. It's 2023, can we just let men talk about legitimate male health and mental health issues without laughing at or dismissing them?? I could say so much more... I don't have words for the racism of the press towards Meghan (and honestly, I'm not even that big of a Meghan fan, but damn), the mistreatment of the royal family by the British media, the complicity of certain members of the royal family in all of this.

I can only hope that, as unlikely as it seems, the honesty in this book helps contribute to some measure of healing in a family that, by the author's own admission, is very big, very old, and very broken.Show more",4,I wanted to hate this book I wanted to find its tone whiney selffocused and entitledsomething like the memoir equivalent of a man cold Im not sure why maybe my childhood crush on and bizarre sense of identification with Prince William I too often feel the weight of being the oldest child In any case my hopes of hating this memoir were squelched almost immediately Im glad I read this bookFirst off Ill concede the memoir is hardly perfect what book is  Were there a number of factual inaccuracies Yes eg Harry was not related to Henry VI but all of them that I noticed anyway seem inadvertent neither malevolent nor selfaggrandizing Even the best books contain errors and editorial gaffes Because of the level of scrutiny this book has received early on these errors have become apparent more quickly than they would have in a similar book Was it long Yes but purposefully so What makes it long is not endless whining as so much of the media and ignorant comments on social media have portrayed This is not the endless drivel of a man complaining on and on about his life I found the writing to be compelling selfaware and an honest attempt to come to terms not only with his life but with his own selfhis failings his shortcomings his complicity in many of the problems he points out The trajectory of the book was solid and well composedcompelling themes and symbolism were woven in and out across the whole work The chapters flowed and in general I could not put the book down I finished the entire 15hr audio version read by Prince Harry himself within 45 days The book benefitted from being ghostwritten by acclaimed novelist J R Moehringer which H publicly disclosed in the early stages of producing his memoir back in 2021 and the effect is a thoroughly wellconstructed almost literary quality memoir Are there outrageous claims Yes but most of them are verifiable and many of them have already been acknowledged by members of the media What isnt verifiable is in the normal realm of memoir writingthe authors memories emotions etc Was everything in his description of family dynamics objectively true in an absolute sense Probably not Probably like any other human effort to tell a story there are two sides and the truth lies somewhere in between But if even a fraction of what he has said is true in any authoritative way then holy hell Theres a serious problem with what the British press and others have been able to get away with  While this book take down the monarchy Not likely and thats not Prince Harrys purpose I was caught off guard by how faithful and loving he was towards the Queen and the monarchy as an institution He is simply holding the monarchy to a higher and more humanizing standardand striving to do so out of fidelity and loveNow that Ive read the book in its entirety I can see that virtually every negative review or comment Ive read on the internet about it has been written either by someone who hasnt actually read the work or who has only read it enough to take a few stray quotes out of context and misrepresent the entire book An example of this everyone keeps mentioning the frozen todger bit as though to suggest how shameless and petulant Harry must be for talking about his penis getting frosbitten while on an expedition to the Arctic If you read the full section though its pretty clear that although hes a bit tongueincheek for a line or two his reason for including this anecdote was to illustrate a bigger painpoint in his life He was trying to show how difficult it can be when you are so hunted by the media that virtually anyone can be bought off even medical professionals to get help for such a sensitive and intimate health issue I can identify with this since I would rather drive a rusted nail slowly into my eyeball than see a doctor for a problem down there and I dont have photographers tracking my every move Harry put off seeing a doctor despite excruciating pain hoping the problem would resolve itself When it didntwhen he was in constant pain and could barely even pee anymorehe was forced to go to a clinic and nearly had a panic attack about it Its 2023 can we just let men talk about legitimate male health and mental health issues without laughing at or dismissing them I could say so much more I dont have words for the racism of the press towards Meghan and honestly Im not even that big of a Meghan fan but damn the mistreatment of the royal family by the British media the complicity of certain members of the royal family in all of this Its maddening I can only hope that as unlikely as it seems the honesty in this book helps contribute to some measure of healing in a family that by the authors own admission is very big very old and very brokenShow more

Rating 5 out of 5,"RATING: 5 full of admiration star 🌟I’ve always been a huge fan of Harry & Meghan, and a lot has been said about them in these past few years. I couldn’t help myself, my curiosity got the best of me and I got the audiobook. And let me say, this book does more than put my curiosity to rest, it had me saying bravo, well done Harry!! Your mother would be so proud of you.This was an astounding gut level story of this man’s life and experiences. It had me in tears at so many points. You can sense his hurt in the book.I believe everything in this book. I do not think Harry has a reason to lie; whereas the royal family has a lot to lose if people believe him. So of course, they will fight tooth and nails to make Harry look like a fool. But they don’t fool me!Harry did what no one had the guts to do for Diana, he stood up for his family with this book. And I think his mother would be more than proud of him for that.This story tugged at my mama’s bear heart strings. It was an incredibly poignant story of a traumatized boy by the sudden and very brutal departure of his mother. And this boy was scared of seeing history repeating itself with the love of his life. It was truly an honor to listen to it. I think it is a privilege for anyone to hear Prince Harry’s story from Prince Harry himself that had his story (incorrectly & unwillingly) told by others over so many years. Now it’s his turn to tell you himself his side of the story.

Rating 3 out of 5,"I was a fan of Harry's going into this one and had heard and seen quite a bit about this book before reading it. I thought Harry did a great job of being frank, good and bad stuff, even the things he did that were stupid. He realized it and owned up to it, something most of his family does not do. I feel bad for Harry with the way that his family has ostracized and betrayed him, all in the name of the institution. I was glad that Harry found Megan, that the two of them were able to break away and live life on their terms and find the peace they want.Show more",3,I was a fan of Harrys going into this one and had heard and seen quite a bit about this book before reading it I thought Harry did a great job of being frank good and bad stuff even the things he did that were stupid He realized it and owned up to it something most of his family does not do I feel bad for Harry with the way that his family has ostracized and betrayed him all in the name of the institution I was glad that Harry found Megan that the two of them were able to break away and live life on their terms and find the peace they wantShow more

Rating 2 out of 5,"Whew, I just finished and I’m glad that’s over. 😮‍💨 Let me save your time from reading 400 pages!My overall thoughts: -I mistrust this book. Prince Harry admits to a shaky memory, apparently too traumatized to recall anything much before his mother’s death. He acknowledges the ‘superb fact-checking’ of one Hilary McClellen, but no! she has allowed numerous howlers to slip through, causing me to wonder how much else Prince Harry has got wrong or simply cooked up to sell his book. One example being the Xbox! -The only NEW revelation I learned from the book was that Harry got frostbite on his penis and then used Elizabeth Arden cream on it thinking that would help. Spoiler (it didn’t 😂) 🤢-Meghan is literally always on the floor sobbing at the exact moment Harry gets home and turns the doorknob. Whether by herself or with others, she is always ""collapsing."" And she needs to be protected because she knows nothing of the world and how mean people can be. 😂😂😂-Do I feel like Meghan wrote some of it? You bet your ass I do. 😬-Meghan told Harry when they first met that she was in England so much that she would sometimes leave her luggage at the hotels for weeks on end. So, she spent all this time in England but then claimed to Harry that she didn’t know anything about the Royal Family. 😆🤣 Harry is an idiot because he didn’t even question it.

Rating 4 out of 5,"‘Spare’ is indeed, the sensational memoir by Prince Harry – ghost-written by Pulitzer-prize winning author and journalist, J.R. Moehringer – and which is currently the fastest-selling nonfiction book of all time (according to Guinness World Records) having sold 1.43 million copies on its first day, unseating Barack Obama’s memoir record. With my agent hat on too; Harry's non-fiction book is also giving a good news boost to the most beleaguered bookish format of the pandemic, which desperately needed it (from 2022 roundup, Publishers Weekly; ""...with the largest drop coming in the industry’s biggest category, adult nonfiction, where print sales fell 10.3%."") A rising tide floats all boats, and the same way the Obama's memoirs boosted non-fiction sales the world over, so too is Harry's when the form has been floundering. Bravo, and many thanks! I listened to the audiobook (which was a phenomenal experience in itself, highly recommend - and not just because at AUD$23 the iTunes audiobook is way cheaper than the RRP hardback at indie bookstores, a AUD$60 whopper!) What immediately struck me about ‘Spare’ is how well-written it is. Once the Spanish translation dropped a week ahead of embargoed release, and the press (largely driven by the British media pack) started picking it apart with their teeth, they very much implied that it was a salacious piece of ‘Mommie Dearest,’-esque tat. But it’s not that. It’s ghost-written by J.R. Moehringer who is a Pulitzer prize-winning journalist, and it shows in evocative and haunting writing (early on there are descriptions of a childhood at Balmoral, like it’s a Highland Disneyland – full of beloved ghosts and legends – and from those evocative pages you just know you’re in very good storytelling hands.) Moehringer also gifts ‘Spare’ with an important journalistic structure; that there is an argument and thematic through-line to the entire thing … which is; the breakdown of the 4th estate for their embedded relationship with the royal family, and the toxicity of the press – particularly the British tabloid press. For all that people have been making fun of frozen todgers and Freudian Elizabeth Arden that’s also in the pages, it is actually a book with a lot of subtle layers and connections made throughout, and I was genuinely impressed at the literary prowess and strong argument at the heart of ‘Spare.’ And I’m also not surprised that the same press pushing the salaciousness are doing so to avoid Harry’s true grievance and message which is; a large corner of the British press, owned by Rupert Murdoch (who Harry takes repeated and named aim at), is not fit for purpose. He’s taking the angle of how this has almost become like an abusive relationship the royals have wandered into and now can’t get out of (on his father Charles’s relationship to the press; “He hated their hate, but oh - how he loved their love!”) but I read it and more see the implication that if a large cohort of the media are in bed with the royals, and can be bribed with leaks and tattle-tale from their comms teams, to swap out weighted stories for clickbait … then who is *actually* holding one of the most powerful families and institutions to account, if it’s not the 4th estate – who are seemingly bought and paid for, by the royal family? I’m sure that’s not the actual message Harry intended people to take away – but it’s there for the taking, certainly. And this is probably closer to the real reasons the royals, their ‘true believer’ staff, and the cottage-industry of media who make money off their backs - are really disgruntled with Harry – because if you start tugging on one thread of his story, the whole institution starts to unravel with his revelations. This happens a few times throughout, actually – Harry gets pretty close to a deeper understanding, but keeps it at the personal and somewhat surface-level and refrains from taking it out-wide into the ramifications for the monarchy. In fact; Harry’s ongoing support for monarchy is a small mark against the book overall, in my opinion – but I understand, the same way that 13-year-old Harry recounts travelling to Africa with his father and hearing an oral historian recount the Zulu War, which Harry listens to intently and only reveres the ‘red coats’ mentioned in the battle … I get it; he’s had more conditioning and indoctrination than most, and it’ll take longer and a lot more to break those bonds that have been ingrained and sold for him as a birthright and history to be proud of. I can appreciate that he’s signalling he needs to put more work in (and he admits as much; he looks back on that memory of hearing about the Zulu war, and can now see the glitch in his thinking). The other mark against the book for me was the war chapters (yes I'm anti-war, but I know why Harry included them for his ongoing work with veterans and mental health - which makes a very good case for inclusion in the book) ... no, it's more because I was bored listening to how a helicopter works. Total snooze-fest! Grief is the other big theme of this book – and love. Those two, always together and entwined. Harry really sadly speaks of being in his early 20s and certain he’ll be a “young dad” – marry young and start a family. It’s pretty clear that his own family is not close and overly-affectionate and he wants to start that for himself, have that and build it. But he’s constantly thwarted – girlfriends are scared off by the media and he’s lonely. That also rings very, hurtfully, true. He’s a lonely kid who grows up to be a lonely young man, wayward and a little lost most of the time. Especially after the media also help in cutting-short his army career (leaks mean his position in Iraq and Afghanistan are signalled to the enemy - an Australian woman's magazine is actually the first to break an embargo and print his whereabouts - putting him and many around him in danger. FFS, it happens so often throughout - he's utterly warranted in hating them, the bogeymen of his childhood grown to being his adult tormentors). It's why the Meghan chapters feel like a turning-point in so many ways - because what is absolutely undoubted is how much he loves her. He's absolutely head-over-heels, and frankly I get it. She's *gorgeous* and charming, intelligent and thoughtful ... a real ""ohhhhhh,"" moment comes early in their relationship, when Harry recounts a small argument they had, inconsequential - but he responds with too much rage and tone that the situation does not call for. Meghan calmly slips away, Harry goes to find her once he's also more centred and she says - in no uncertain terms - that she won't be spoken to that way, ever, and this will not be how they go about arguing (with rage). Harry sheepishly apologises, and Meghan asks him if there's a reason he thinks that's the way adults settle arguments (this is also when she gently asks him if he's ever had therapy - to which Harry says he tried, but it didn't work. Meghan probably saves his life when she says, ""try again."")I see a lot of people mocking his constant references to “mummy,” and the many times he looks for spiritual connections and signs from her (at one point even speaking to a spirit-medium, which he’s pretty sure is bunk, but is also desperate enough for connection to at least give it a go.) I’m very happy for the people who’ve never lost a loved one, making fun of all this stuff in the memoir and trying to push Freudian connections. Congratulations to them. I just read it as a deep well of grief that keeps painfully contracting and expanding. Listening to this on audiobook, it was a wholly wrenching and wonderful listening experience – not least because deep missing and love for Diana rings through his voice, as does his grief. Harry is at once self-deprecating and serious when he details what he believes to be signs from Diana, and it’s hard to fault him on this when - for instance - Tyler Perry even surprisingly says the reason he offered to help Harry and Meghan settle in America, is Diana (his late mum was a fan) or Archie fixating on an old-looking painting at Perry’s house, which upon closer-inspection has a plaque stating that it is a depiction of goddess Diana – on the hunt. I do get it, the spiritual medium stuff *is* odd, but it’s also … grief. I’ve patiently listened to family who’ve detailed signs they’ve received from our loved ones who passed, and I believe that they believe it because they need to. That’s all.The big thing that surprised me in this book was, I came away with a better opinion of William and Kate Middleton (I KNOW! Who'd have thunk?) For all that the press have glommed onto they physical altercations and intimidation between the Heir and the Spare, I think Harry actually highlights a few realities of royal life I was unaware of and works to show the ways that his whole family - but maybe his older brother especially - are trapped by this cycle that Charles and Camilla in particular, welcomed into the royal roster (that is; the hiring of ex-Government and media spin-doctors in comms teams, a precedent of leaking against each other and an unhealthy obsession with tracking their popularity as catalogued by the media ...) The fact that the only other person around who can understand William's unique and difficult position is his own father, who is obsessed with one-upping his son as the next in line to the throne. I genuinely got the impression that William is stuck, and lashing out because of it - and has little to no interest in the Crown whatsoever, but is playing the part he's been assigned.What's missing from 'Spare' seems to be a surprising amount. Namely to do with the Queen and Prince Philip who are both really missing from its pages ... I'd suggest that might have been a decision after both their deaths, and in respect to the fact that they couldn't respond to any of Harry's claims. There's a part of me - personally - that wonders if a big thread that was cut out, is whether or not the Queen in her later-years was not as ""with it"" when it came to these machinations with the press and day-to-day decisions of her office? I'd say that's likely, and I would not be surprised if royal employees (like the Bee, Wasp and Fly who Harry aliases from her comms teams) and maybe under permission of Charles & Co. over-stepped, lied, and did as they thought best, knowing the Queen wasn't as hands-on as she'd previously been. “Is he in the room with you, granny?” Harry asks his grandmother at one point, after he's been thwarted in seeing her by one of her courtiers (after she'd encouraged him only the day before, to come and see her since she had the whole day free.) Mmmmm. I think it’s possible that what was left out of ‘Spare’ could have been questions about the Queen’s capacities in her final years, and maybe how some people in her circle took advantage of her diminished health …'Spare' has been made out to be a bit of a circus. It's not that. It's Harry, I think, providing his own historic record and ensuring that one primary product of the press (stories about him, and his wife) are depleted by him, and him alone (yes, for profit - which is another revenge against those who've been profiting off their story and tragedy for years.)He's taking all the air out of his own tale, so that it is devalued for those people who've plagued him - and his family - their whole lives. In doing so he's also taking a considerable amount of shine off the Crown jewels, for sure. Showing that at the end of the day, they're just people - as dysfunctional as most others. Once this historic family of Harry's held onto their divine right by blood and battle - now the battlefield has changed to the press and social media, but there's still a war being raged and if nothing else, Harry is taking himself and his family off the chess-board once and for all.

Rating 2 out of 5,"I am quite torn on how to rate this book... on one hand the majority isn't written very well (you can really tell which sections the ghostwriter helped with) and is full of moments where ""recollections may vary"" aka getting tripped up by previous lies or wildly wrong misremembrances (like the entirely made up scene about getting a phone call that the Queen Mum had died alone in his dorm at school when there are photos of him together with Charles and William having to fly home from a ski trip for the funeral). On the other hand, as a life long royal watcher I had an absolute blast reading this and would have been happy for another 400 pages of content because the anecdotes shared are hilarious, odd, and often deeply cringe-worthy. It is wild how many previously vehemently denied tabloid rumours he confirms and fascinating to have the palace curtains lifted a bit (while at the same time I feel bad for those members of his family who's privacy he has infringed on by sharing some very personal information and conversations).Overall, hearing Harry's story in his own words reveals someone who is more deeply damaged by his mother's death than the public would have previously guessed and who continues to struggle with addiction/substance abuse and serious mental health issues to this day. Many of his revelations about Diana are so personal, I felt almost guilty reading about them... from his delusions that she was still alive which he seems to have been convinced of until his mid-20s to details about talking to the box of her hair that he keeps on his nightstand to the animals/signs that he feels she sends to him to visits to psychics to try to séance with her spirit to a particularly disturbing scene involving her lip cream and his genitals (that I wish I could wipe from my memory), Ghost!Diana is essentially another main character in this memoir despite admitting that he has blocked nearly all his childhood memories and sadly can't really remember her. It is clear that his family has been worried about his mental health and erratic behaviour for a long time... I came away with a similar feeling as watching the Demi Levato documentary wherein her friends and family are still very concerned but the person is saying that they are doing so much better while still not fully committed to sobriety or effective therapy. In Harry's case he continues to advocate for the use of psychedelic drugs as medicine and many of the ""therapists"" that he thanks for supporting him are practitioners of pseudoscience. I really hope that he is eventually able to find some peace from his grief which seems to still be quite all consuming and motivating many of his decisions.I'm not sure if he will get the reaction he is hoping for with this book and will probably ultimately regret its publication... I think public sympathy would have been higher if they had stopped sharing royal drama after the Oprah interview or only made the Netflix documentary, and ultimately you will never be able to make everyone like you no matter how much you repeat or tweak your story. There are definitely some stories in this book that I would never have shared if I was in his shoes; however, I'm still really glad I read it to hear his perspective. Obviously it is a very one-sided account, and as someone who has followed along for years there is often context or incidents that I remember from watching in real time that are left out or obfuscated in the book to better bolster his characterization of events. If you are coming into this book without knowing the background of his story I would urge you to take a lot of things with a grain of salt or read some of the fact checking articles that have a more fullsome outlook. Ultimately I could not put this down and alternated between laughter, incredulity and pity from page to page.Show more",2,I am quite torn on how to rate this book on one hand the majority isnt written very well you can really tell which sections the ghostwriter helped with and is full of moments where recollections may vary aka getting tripped up by previous lies or wildly wrong misremembrances like the entirely made up scene about getting a phone call that the Queen Mum had died alone in his dorm at school when there are photos of him together with Charles and William having to fly home from a ski trip for the funeral On the other hand as a life long royal watcher I had an absolute blast reading this and would have been happy for another 400 pages of content because the anecdotes shared are hilarious odd and often deeply cringeworthy It is wild how many previously vehemently denied tabloid rumours he confirms and fascinating to have the palace curtains lifted a bit while at the same time I feel bad for those members of his family whos privacy he has infringed on by sharing some very personal information and conversationsOverall hearing Harrys story in his own words reveals someone who is more deeply damaged by his mothers death than the public would have previously guessed and who continues to struggle with addictionsubstance abuse and serious mental health issues to this day Many of his revelations about Diana are so personal I felt almost guilty reading about them from his delusions that she was still alive which he seems to have been convinced of until his mid20s to details about talking to the box of her hair that he keeps on his nightstand to the animalssigns that he feels she sends to him to visits to psychics to try to séance with her spirit to a particularly disturbing scene involving her lip cream and his genitals that I wish I could wipe from my memory GhostDiana is essentially another main character in this memoir despite admitting that he has blocked nearly all his childhood memories and sadly cant really remember her It is clear that his family has been worried about his mental health and erratic behaviour for a long time I came away with a similar feeling as watching the Demi Levato documentary wherein her friends and family are still very concerned but the person is saying that they are doing so much better while still not fully committed to sobriety or effective therapy In Harrys case he continues to advocate for the use of psychedelic drugs as medicine and many of the therapists that he thanks for supporting him are practitioners of pseudoscience I really hope that he is eventually able to find some peace from his grief which seems to still be quite all consuming and motivating many of his decisionsIm not sure if he will get the reaction he is hoping for with this book and will probably ultimately regret its publication I think public sympathy would have been higher if they had stopped sharing royal drama after the Oprah interview or only made the Netflix documentary and ultimately you will never be able to make everyone like you no matter how much you repeat or tweak your story There are definitely some stories in this book that I would never have shared if I was in his shoes however Im still really glad I read it to hear his perspective Obviously it is a very onesided account and as someone who has followed along for years there is often context or incidents that I remember from watching in real time that are left out or obfuscated in the book to better bolster his characterization of events If you are coming into this book without knowing the background of his story I would urge you to take a lot of things with a grain of salt or read some of the fact checking articles that have a more fullsome outlook Ultimately I could not put this down and alternated between laughter incredulity and pity from page to pageShow more
Rating 4 out of 5,"Honestly, good for him. I can empathize greatly with grieving in front of cameras (my brother Zach Sobiech had the end of his life documented, and also had a biopic made of his life: Clouds), and while it might look like privilege on the outset, it really is just another layer of complexity that augments pain and loss. Your memories are replaced with other people’s iterations of who they wanted your loved one to be, and you know it and you can’t stop it from editing the person you knew and loved. It’s depressing, but then you feel guilty about it because everyone thinks you should be grateful for the “enormous privilege” of fame. Fame, at the end of the day, is so hollow and pointless and just not real. It always looks different looking in than it really is. The best way I can describe it is the stupid red carpet at the airport. It’s just a gross red rug that people say makes you special. After 2016 to the most recent election, I can empathize hugely with boundary setting and breaking away from family structures that don’t serve your family anymore. It’s ballsy, it’s not fun, and you end up realizing that sometimes, you’re just telling the truth as you see it primarily for yourself so you can make sense of things and move forward with a shred of sanity left. I see this memoir as Harry making sense of it all and laying it out primarily for himself. The risk, of course, is keeping your own self righteousness in check and no one is perfect. There were times I felt beaten over the head about the paps ruining every aspect of his life, but obviously there’s a reason for that. I also felt the writing was rather dramatic and self-centered at times, but such is being human.Show more",4,Honestly good for him I can empathize greatly with grieving in front of cameras my brother Zach Sobiech had the end of his life documented and also had a biopic made of his life Clouds and while it might look like privilege on the outset it really is just another layer of complexity that augments pain and loss Your memories are replaced with other peoples iterations of who they wanted your loved one to be and you know it and you cant stop it from editing the person you knew and loved Its depressing but then you feel guilty about it because everyone thinks you should be grateful for the enormous privilege of fame Fame at the end of the day is so hollow and pointless and just not real It always looks different looking in than it really is The best way I can describe it is the stupid red carpet at the airport Its just a gross red rug that people say makes you special After 2016 to the most recent election I can empathize hugely with boundary setting and breaking away from family structures that dont serve your family anymore Its ballsy its not fun and you end up realizing that sometimes youre just telling the truth as you see it primarily for yourself so you can make sense of things and move forward with a shred of sanity left I see this memoir as Harry making sense of it all and laying it out primarily for himself The risk of course is keeping your own self righteousness in check and no one is perfect There were times I felt beaten over the head about the paps ruining every aspect of his life but obviously theres a reason for that I also felt the writing was rather dramatic and selfcentered at times but such is being humanShow more

There were so many anecdotes that added no substantive value to this book—they were there simply to be mean or to sell copies. He comes across not only as mean (the name calling, the quip about journalists paying their rent because of him) but also as thinking he’s the first kid to have family trauma or a rebellious phase. It seems he was trying to garner sympathy (or attempt to be relatable) by saying they were able to scrape together pennies to put a down payment on a home, failing to mention it’s a $14.7 million dollar home.

Rating 2 out of 5,"I told myself I wasn't gonna read this book! I could care less about the royal family! Alas, my curiosity got the best of me...I thought this was going to be a kind of text therapy for the former prince, an attempt to get out of the shadow of his brother, father, and the entire royal family, a way to identify his pain, to look at himself and his life from an outside perspective, but no, this was a naked desire to make money. Even after learning such intimate details about the royal family, I don't care about them. The only thing I want to say is that this book did not impress me whatsoever and rather made me laugh.

Rating 5 out of 5,"I really enjoyed listening to this on audible books. I also feel like if you don't listen to Prince Harry narrate this book you truly miss out on it by not hearing him tell his own story in his own voice, dialect and words. The way he emphasizes certain feelings and such. I also loved his British accent but that is besides the point. Before reading this, my viewpoint of Harry and Meghan had been swayed poorly by the press. But after reading this and especially hearing him tell it, I have changed my mind. Speaking of the press and especially the paparazzi that plagued him and his family his whole life, and who he and Willliam blame for killing his beloved mother, I think they are terrible at spreading lies for money. They will do whatever it takes to get money and they stop at nothing. Harry talks in his book of his anxiety issues due to the ""paps"". This book was broken into three parts. His childhood and time with Diana and the tragic loss of her and his time being raised. Then his time with friends, followed by time in the Army and the War. I thought it was very interesting listening to everything he went through. He had some very difficult experiences that had a profound effect on him. I loved hearing him talk about his love of being a Chinook pilot, because he had become so talented and accurate doing his job. The third part was about meeting Meghan and his deep love for her. The progression of things through marriage and then through to the way things are after the Queen has passed. This was a heartfelt memoir and I appreciated hearing Harry telling everything that happened, leaving no details out, not even embarrassing ones for himself. It had to be very hard to do, but he just puts it all out there. I can tell he could have been much more harsh on his royal family in this book, but after all he's been through he still loves them and was mature and kind enough to keep it civil and decent to them. All in all, this was so interesting to listen to. There is a lot more I did not mention that is just as great to hear, like how he talks about their favorite time in Botswana. I gained a new insight not only on Prince Harry and Meghan, but on the Royal family as well.

Rating 5 out of 5,"Audio (Audible). 5 stars. I knew this would be a popular book in 2023 and wanted first dibs, so I preordered it using one of my Audible credits. What I knew about Royal culture had been absorbed through press headlines, and I've never harbored much of an opinion about their lives. Like so many, I remember the heartbreak of Princess Diana's tragic death and feeling sad for the two young boys who lost their mother. This book is more than just stories of Prince Harry's life, and it most definitely is NOT a whiney, privileged bemoaning of how he's been poorly portrayed in the media. He comes clean about mistakes he's made, lapses in judgement, poor decisions. He doesn't make excuses about them and he expresses genuine regret. He has a profound desire to serve his country, and there are many chapters devoted to his time fighting the war in Iraq and Afghanistan (I found these chapters to be some of my favorite), as well as his efforts to support veterans. What stands out as a common, inescapable theme of this book is the role of the paparazzi (paps) in destroying his life--not just how they caused the accident that killed his mom, but how they invaded the privacy of any girlfriend he had, and the way they aggressively, intentionally antagonize him, hoping he'll react aggressively in return because the photos fetch such a handsome sum (100K pounds!). Although Harry himself admits to being a ""crap writer,"" the writing in this book has moments of beautiful eloquence and imagery--a testament, no doubt, to some truly fantastic editing and Harry's willingness to be truly vulnerable in the process. This book evokes a sense of compassion for unimaginable mental duress, admiration for Harry's dedication to veterans and children, and a feeling that he is truly his mother's son--trying so hard to assure that his family can be safe while continuing her mission of service. I cried numerous times throughout this book. Listening to him narrate his own book definitely elevated the experience.A few sections felt less edited (and less moving), leaving me with a sense that the editing team ran out of time to truly perfect the final product. Nevertheless, this is still a 5-star book that will likely be one of my top/most memorable reads of 2023.

Rating 4 out of 5,"3.5 stars, rounded upI really don’t know how to review this one. I listened to audio, which is the only way to go with celebrity memoirs (in my opinion). I like Harry & Meghan and feel for how challenging their situation has been. It was written in short chapters, so often felt clipped and jumpy with subject changes. Parts of the book felt like the reader was getting a peek at Harry’s personal journal! Like we got too much information. I tend to skim past those parts, since I’m of the philosophy to “take what you like and leave the rest”. Interesting to hear about Harry’s time in the service and how he became a pilot. He also addressed many of the rumors about him over the years and gave his own take. I’m happy for Harry that he’s been able to get therapy and process so much of his grief. His mother’s death was so devastating and it seemed like he & William didn’t get much support afterwards. I also liked when he stood up to his family regarding his marriage and family.

Rating 3 out of 5,"Things I have learned from reading this book:1.) Prince Harry was close to his grandmother Queen Elizabeth II in many ways, but still, he never hugged her. The description of despair when she passed in September last year is painful. The family's lack of unity too.2.) The paps (the press) can destroy people's lives. (I already knew that, but reading about it in this book is quite harsh.) 3.) Prince Harry misses his mum. A lot. He was never given a proper chance to mourn her death back in 1997. It seems as if he is working his way through it now. 4.) Prince Charles is passionate about Shakespeare!5.) The British Royal family seems dysfunctional in so many ways.6.) Prince Harry has used cocaine, smoked marijuana, tried magic mushrooms and yeah, he's quite open about his drug use.7.) There is tension between Harry & Meghan and William & Kate. Between all four. Between the two ladies. Between the two brothers. Not easy.8.) Harry and Meghan give the impression that they love each other a lot. (As if I didn't know after having watch their Netflix documentary...)9.) When Harry & Meghan signed several corporate partnerships before Christmas 2020, they did it for these reasons (p. 397): - it would give them a chance to resume their work- to spotlight the causes they care about- to tell the stories they felt were vital- .... and to pay for security. 10.) Reading about Harry in the military was at times extremely boring.11.) Camilla, the Queen Consort, is portrayed as rather dodgy.12.)

Rating 4 out of 5,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ | I had no intention of reading this book. ...Even with my love for Meghan Markle and my intrigue in her and Harry’s move to California, I was still uninterested. And then the Netflix documentary came out.I wanted to know the nitty-gritty details that we didn’t get in the documentary, but more so, I wanted to be able to engage with all of you reviewers and your conversations about the book. So basically, FOMO is why I read this book. Even though many aspects are black and white when it comes to Harry and Meghan Markle and what they have gone through, Prince Harry alone - there is so much to consider: how he was raised, who has raised him, where he comes from, and how he has chosen to embark on telling his truth - the fact that he can. And let’s face it, his weaponization of memory. Because that is exactly what this is. Whether that memory is accurate or not is irrelevant, and to be clear, I believe his accounts…but one still cannot deny that he is using it as a weapon against the Royal Family. And we are all here for it because, duh, ending all forms of white supremacy is the ultimate goal.Also, Prince Harry is a marvel to some degree. He is a man of privilege, yes. Born into royalty, yes. Yet he essentially gave up royalty for the sake of his physical and mental health and the health and safety of his family. And the even bigger kicker, arguably, he still retains and wields the same, if not more, of the same power and privilege he once had, which is nuts. I mean, he’s a white man, but you have to admit it’s a feat. So, that’s why I wanted to read this. I want to hear his story, his recollection, the entire account of his life, presumably, in his voice, INCLUDING THE MESS (duh, why we are all here).…Spare, the title hinting at Prince Harry’s role in the Royal Family (sic, “spare” parts if something happens to Will’s bald a**) and no doubt a dig to his father, consists of three parts. Part I is devoted to the period right before and the years following his mother’s death. Part II is devoted to his time in the military. And Part III is the reason we all were here, chronicling the beautiful beginning of his and Megan’s relationship to the present day.While all of the parts are not equally scintillating (or messy), all of them equally underscores three things that I believe we all know to be true about Harry: 1. The death of his mother resulted in a heartbreak that those who have lost a parent know to be true, and he was never given the tools to mend his heart, much less time to grieve his mother 2. Harry had always had an issue with the British press (and rightfully so, considering the circumstances of his mother’s death) long before he laid his eyes on Meghan with a Snapchat dog filter over her face.3. As a result of his mother’s death or improper soul placement (not to bring God into this), he was arguably never built for nor did he want to be a prince.…The tone of the book, particularly in Parts 1 and 2, reads like a man oscillating between his outer adult and his inner child. He makes an astounding case that his mother’s death is the root of everything that made him second-guess his privilege, station, and even perhaps, his purpose.You are practically saturated with his want to be acknowledged, understood, and recognized as a member of his family, as a “spare.” His in-depth recollection of the microaggressions and macroaggressions he experienced most of his childhood before Megan put into perspective why Megan was the tipping point. If the book does nothing else, it underscores the power of grief, duty exacerbated by the external pressure of celebrity (in this case, royalty), and the effects of feeling like one does not belong or matters less than another. And to this extent, I am empathetic to his plight. MY ISSUE: the book reeks of self-indulgence. And I know some of you are like, “Girl, it’s a memoir.” Hear me out.First of all, TO ME, memoirs shouldn’t just answer the question of what happened. Because when they just answer that question, the book ends up having little depth, and it becomes a rehashing of events. The questions that I think a good memoir should answer (and it’s been done: Will Smith, Tabitha Brown, Gabrielle Union, etc.): What happened? How? What was your role?What did you learn?How did XYZ turn you into the person you are today?Memoirs should be just as retrospective as they are introspective.The main question that this book answered: How did XYZ event or conversation result in a change of circumstances from the circumstances that you were born into?And that was it. This is not to minimize what he went through or the feelings that he described as he was going through what he went through.But, I was surprised at the frequent lack of self-awareness. Harry and Meghan are the victims; I will say that with my whole chest, BUT let us not forget that Harry at one time was a participant. He has been both a victim of an institution’s indifference and, at one time, an active participant in its reverence. And this even comes off now, somewhat in the book but definitely in his interviews, when he implies that the monarchy is not the problem; it’s the press. SIR, Da Nile is a river in Egypt. Your family is trash.And what’s even more baffling to me is his focus on delineating the institution from the press or the institution as a whole from his family. SIR, your family has proven countless times that they cannot separate familial relationship from their royal roles and relationship with the press…why are you trying to sell us this lie?And then there was some gross carelessness in some areas of the book…I didn’t care for the metaphor of flying his plane in active war and killing people in the same sentence as him playing a video game or his reference to his conversation with Will where Will says, “Africa is my thing” (and no mention of how this rhetoric is not only indicative of narcissism and entitlement at play but also colonialism) or the severe instances of oversharing (i.e., the frostbite, loss of virginity tidbit, etc.). Some things we didn’t need to know, nor did they contribute to the story. In conclusion, Spare does what it needs to do. It told the story of a heartbroken man who lost his mother young, tried to find himself afterward, met the love of his life, and almost lost her because of a lack of care on the part of his family. It also highlights that families - particularly toxic ones - suffer from the same attributes. Royalty or regular. White, black, brown. Rich, poor in between: gaslighting, not remembering conversations, mood swings, the taking away of resources or their affection to get what they want, lack of boundaries, making small things big things and taking offense, ethnocentrism, etc.…The royals are not unique. They are people, just like us. They are raggedy, petty, led by illusions of grandeur, fear of losing their place in society, and even more importantly, they are set on believing their own lie at the expense of others—literally, the definition of self-preservation.  And in his pursuit of taking care of himself and his family, in his newfound freedom and pursuit of truth-telling, Harry is not going to continue to let them get away with it.God save the Spare. Show more",4,I had no intention of reading this book Even with my love for Meghan Markle and my intrigue in her and Harrys move to California I was still uninterested And then the Netflix documentary came outI wanted to know the nittygritty details that we didnt get in the documentary but more so I wanted to be able to engage with all of you reviewers and your conversations about the book So basically FOMO is why I read this book Even though many aspects are black and white when it comes to Harry and Meghan Markle and what they have gone through Prince Harry alone  there is so much to consider how he was raised who has raised him where he comes from and how he has chosen to embark on telling his truth  the fact that he can And lets face it his weaponization of memory Because that is exactly what this is Whether that memory is accurate or not is irrelevant and to be clear I believe his accountsbut one still cannot deny that he is using it as a weapon against the Royal Family And we are all here for it because duh ending all forms of white supremacy is the ultimate goalAlso Prince Harry is a marvel to some degree He is a man of privilege yes Born into royalty yes Yet he essentially gave up royalty for the sake of his physical and mental health and the health and safety of his family And the even bigger kicker arguably he still retains and wields the same if not more of the same power and privilege he once had which is nuts I mean hes a white man but you have to admit its a feat So thats why I wanted to read this I want to hear his story his recollection the entire account of his life presumably in his voice INCLUDING THE MESS duh why we are all hereSpare the title hinting at Prince Harrys role in the Royal Family sic spare parts if something happens to Wills bald a and no doubt a dig to his father consists of three parts Part I is devoted to the period right before and the years following his mothers death Part II is devoted to his time in the military And Part III is the reason we all were here chronicling the beautiful beginning of his and Megans relationship to the present dayWhile all of the parts are not equally scintillating or messy all of them equally underscores three things that I believe we all know to be true about Harry 1 The death of his mother resulted in a heartbreak that those who have lost a parent know to be true and he was never given the tools to mend his heart much less time to grieve his mother 2 Harry had always had an issue with the British press and rightfully so considering the circumstances of his mothers death long before he laid his eyes on Meghan with a Snapchat dog filter over her face3 As a result of his mothers death or improper soul placement not to bring God into this he was arguably never built for nor did he want to be a princeThe tone of the book particularly in Parts 1 and 2 reads like a man oscillating between his outer adult and his inner child He makes an astounding case that his mothers death is the root of everything that made him secondguess his privilege station and even perhaps his purposeYou are practically saturated with his want to be acknowledged understood and recognized as a member of his family as a spare His indepth recollection of the microaggressions and macroaggressions he experienced most of his childhood before Megan put into perspective why Megan was the tipping point If the book does nothing else it underscores the power of grief duty exacerbated by the external pressure of celebrity in this case royalty and the effects of feeling like one does not belong or matters less than another And to this extent I am empathetic to his plight MY ISSUE the book reeks of selfindulgence And I know some of you are like Girl its a memoir Hear me outFirst of all TO ME memoirs shouldnt just answer the question of what happened Because when they just answer that question the book ends up having little depth and it becomes a rehashing of events The questions that I think a good memoir should answer and its been done Will Smith Tabitha Brown Gabrielle Union etc What happened How What was your roleWhat did you learnHow did XYZ turn you into

Rating 2 out of 5,"I’m from the Diana years and always had a soft spot for Harry. Who wouldn’t feel compassion for the boy forced to walk behind his mother’s coffin at age 12? Well, after reading this book, I feel extremely disappointed in Harry. He’s become a bitter, angry man hell bent on blaming everyone else for his choices & decisions. It’s endless and depressing to read. This story is not in his voice either. I’ve watched many, many interviews with Harry. He has a distinct way of speaking. This book is not his voice. If anything, it’s Meghan’s voice, which is just odd. Finally, Harry has railed against those who have written books about him & accused them of selling his privacy for ££. Yet here he is doing the exact same thing to his family? What a hypocrite.

Rating 4 out of 5,"The unofficial slogan of the Royal Family is “never complain, never explain” so it must be somewhat of a relief for Prince Harry to be able to tell his story. This book is deeply personal and moving. It is far more honest than I was expecting. It’s deeply sad to see the generational trauma that led to Harry and Meghan leaving the Royal Family. It isn’t easy to try to break generational trauma. And I can’t imagine doing it with the eyes of the world on you.

Rating 2 out of 5,"So I did not like this one. I started it because I was curious about what he had to say, I was actually expecting to read things I didn't know about but to my surprise there weren't many. From the start I didn't like the writing style the changes in tone were very drastic and jarring, there were many time jumps back and forth and some were quite confusing. It also felt, sorry to say, but ghost-written, which is fine I guess but it felt like when you do a group project from school and everyone writes a bit and then just put everything together without much editing? well like that. I went with the audiobook for this one as I love when the authors narrate their works, that always gives the book a special something, but on this one it might have been a bad decision. He sounded very bratty, even more on audio, of course his many many frivolous remarks didn't help one bit. I mean I get that there's rivalry between siblings, but enumerating the many things your brother had better than you, or if his room is a bit bigger, man that's too much for my taste, if the rest of the humans were to start complaining about things like that you couldn't catch a moment of peace in your life.What bothers me most is that he complains during the whole book about how he didn't have any privacy and everyone knew everything about him, and then he goes on for almost 16 hours airing everyone's secrets and sharing private moments with the world. Not to talk about all the interviews, Netflix series and so on. And I wonder, if you want to be left alone and a private life, why would you do that? it makes no sense to me whatsoever. Then he goes on about his experience in the war, which was by far the most interesting thing in the book (because IT WAS SOMETHING NEW), and he gives details of how he killed like 20 Taliban fighters, and I mean if you go and say you are concern about your safety and your family why would you make yourself a bigger target that you already are? See the problem here? the narrative is super confusing, changes key aspects many times and sometimes I feel he even contradicts himself. I'm not going to discuss the penis indicent because I still don't get why he decided to include that and told that way in a book. I get it's difficult to be objective when telling your own story but having read quite a few memoirs from well-know people I must say if the author shows a more objective and mature tone in the book, this becomes a better one. In the end I find it hard to feel sorry for him, which I'm guessing was one of the goals of this book. Even if he lived some really tragic moments in his life, and had to deal with the press and what being part of the royal family means, there's just too much airing of dirty laundry, too much feeling sorry for himself and too much throwing every member of his family under the bus. I would just say, if you are extremely curious about him then go read the book but I must warm you, it's really boring, it took me 22 days to read, and I would have normally read it in three under different conditions.

Rating 2 out of 5,"There's nothing wrong with being self-indulgent and venting about your struggles but when you do so publicly you gotta ask yourself a) is it relevant and beneficial to the people around me, my loved ones? and b) is it relevant to society in general?Do I have something beneficial or inspiring to say? In that case Harry completely missed the point. The thing that strikes me as the most annoying is that he, and Meghan subsequently, have the power and the resources of changing the world, they have the opportunity to save lives, to help people, to teach people. If they don't wanna do that they should at least shut up, count their blessings and go live their lives in privacy and peace as they wanted. The constant, unceasing ''woe is me'' attitude prevalent in the whole book as well as the petty arguments and complants about his family do not persuade me that this is something more just a cash grab and a way to stay relevant in a world which is getting harder to live in every day. I'm no Royal Family lover or monarchist but I felt bad for them being exposed like that without their consent. It's unnervingly immature to expose the dirt of your family for the whole world to see. Billions of people have mommy, daddy and sibling issues. Not many people are so egotistical as to write a book about them with so much spite & bitterness. And I think it's pretty low for someone who could influence people in the best way, to release a memoir about himself, when a month ago he released a Netflix show about himself and his wife, when some time ago he went to Oprah to complain about himself and his wife. Half the world is in humanitarian crisis; people are unsure about the future, they struggle with inflation, paying rent, illnesses, abusive relationships... and instead of AT LEAST recognizing the privileges he lived in all his life he chooses to be so ignorant, selfish and spiteful about the people who raised him and nurture him. The part about Afghanistan was the most puzzling to me and made me feel weird because although Harry writes about his time being there with what resembles nostalgia and content, it's appaling how casually comments about killing so many people. It wouldn't be easy for him, yet I've gathered nothing more than that. If you've read this review, please don't make the mistake I did and buy the book. Not even if it's on sale. You'll just support a millionaire with nothing important to say, no relevance to the real world (which can be cruel and dehumanizing, but hey, we suck it up and continue struggling).

Rating 2 out of 5,"I'm (only slightly) ashamed to say I bought into the hype before the book was even released. I followed every breaking story before the book hit the shelves; I quickly pre-ordered what I was told would be a watershed moment in the history of the Royal Family. A surefire redemption for a prince under scrutiny from the press and the public.In truth, the book was a cataclysmic nothingness, smothered uncomfortably in Elizabeth Arden cream. Coming in at (a simply unneccessary) 400 pages, Harry details his life as the second-rate 'spare' in the royal family. One cannot help but feel some sympathy for him; the loss of Diana was scarring and damaging to him and his family; his relationships were complicated and short-lived; and his marriage to Meghan was dampened by a vicious and derogatory crusade at the hands of the press, and even those dearest to him. Were these anecdotes compressed into a slim, 150-page or so paperback, perhaps I would have retained this sympathy for Harry. Yet, they were sporadically dotted in a droll narrative of privilege and confusion, coaxed in the cringeworthy writing style of a 2016 BuzzFeed video script. Ultimately, Harry has proved to the world what we all suspected to be true: he lives an extremely isolated life, and is out of touch with the routine, and slightly depressing, regularities of human existence. Brotherly fights painted out as civil wars; cold parenting catastrophised into systematic paternal neglect. Indeed, when life seems so cruel and inescapable, Harry's first instinct is to ring up Elton John or Tyler Perry, escaping to a French chalet or guarded LA mansion when the comforts of the Royal Estates simply won't do. What a heartening show of vulnerability to the world...When Harry's ghost-writer isn't bogged down with detailing fighter-jet jargon or describing the Prince's frost-bitten crown jewels, they take extra care to portray him as a free-spirited and painfully modern man. Whether an Eton schoolboy, or as a father self-exiled to the States, Harry is always smoking a joint (or a spliff, or a blunt... if there's a word for it, Harry's mentioned it). Anachronistic episodes of him losing his virginity to an equine-loving old lady (deserving of a detailed, Freudian analysis); his unflattering bowel movements at formal occasions, and flurry of genital-related peculiarities show Harry in his least relatable, most disturbing state. There is nothing exciting about a young man in a gilded cage proving he is 'not like other princes' through a show of sexual blunders, unpredictable excrements, and celebratory drug use. Harry has long spoken of his desire to stay out of the limelight. Perhaps this was the result of a lifetime of genuine anguish and anger towards the people and institutions who have wronged him.To that I say: Harry, there was no need to write this book. All you need is a big hug, and several courses of therapy.Show more",2,Im only slightly ashamed to say I bought into the hype before the book was even released I followed every breaking story before the book hit the shelves I quickly preordered what I was told would be a watershed moment in the history of the Royal Family A surefire redemption for a prince under scrutiny from the press and the publicIn truth the book was a cataclysmic nothingness smothered uncomfortably in Elizabeth Arden cream Coming in at a simply unneccessary 400 pages Harry details his life as the secondrate spare in the royal family One cannot help but feel some sympathy for him the loss of Diana was scarring and damaging to him and his family his relationships were complicated and shortlived and his marriage to Meghan was dampened by a vicious and derogatory crusade at the hands of the press and even those dearest to him Were these anecdotes compressed into a slim 150page or so paperback perhaps I would have retained this sympathy for Harry Yet they were sporadically dotted in a droll narrative of privilege and confusion coaxed in the cringeworthy writing style of a 2016 BuzzFeed video script Ultimately Harry has proved to the world what we all suspected to be true he lives an extremely isolated life and is out of touch with the routine and slightly depressing regularities of human existence Brotherly fights painted out as civil wars cold parenting catastrophised into systematic paternal neglect Indeed when life seems so cruel and inescapable Harrys first instinct is to ring up Elton John or Tyler Perry escaping to a French chalet or guarded LA mansion when the comforts of the Royal Estates simply wont do What a heartening show of vulnerability to the worldWhen Harrys ghostwriter isnt bogged down with detailing fighterjet jargon or describing the Princes frostbitten crown jewels they take extra care to portray him as a freespirited and painfully modern man Whether an Eton schoolboy or as a father selfexiled to the States Harry is always smoking a joint or a spliff or a blunt if theres a word for it Harrys mentioned it Anachronistic episodes of him losing his virginity to an equineloving old lady deserving of a detailed Freudian analysis his unflattering bowel movements at formal occasions and flurry of genitalrelated peculiarities show Harry in his least relatable most disturbing state There is nothing exciting about a young man in a gilded cage proving he is not like other princes through a show of sexual blunders unpredictable excrements and celebratory drug use Harry has long spoken of his desire to stay out of the limelight Perhaps this was the result of a lifetime of genuine anguish and anger towards the people and institutions who have wronged himTo that I say Harry there was no need to write this book All you need is a big hug and several courses of therapyShow more
Rating 5 out of 5,"I really loved this book. I listened on Audible, where Prince Harry is the narrator. It felt more like listening to a story than ""reading an audiobook"". I have never been an official fan of all-things-royal - but I do have recollections and memories regarding them. I wasn't going to read the book because there had been so much negative press about Harry and Meg in the papers and I didn't want to feed into the drama. I finally said yes to this purchase because I am a HUGE fan of authors reading their own work on Audible. To me, this book was nothing of the sort when it came to feeding drama. I thoroughly enjoyed the shorter chapters, the progression through time, the honesty of sharing both the good and the bad. Harry shares some intimate thoughts and moments with his readers that we would never know otherwise. He has a great sense of humor that is revealed in both the words he writes and the way he reads them.But most of all, reading Harry's book reminded me that our lives are always about perspective. What we see, hear, read and believe is always filtered through our own personal perspective. Harry is very careful not to tell this story from anyone else's perspective but his own. It is how HE perceived life around him. He was born into a life filled with expectations he did not ask for. He signed no contract and tried to make the best of it as long as he could. When he tried to change the world he lived in, it clearly wasn't possible to do so - so he changed the only thing he had power over, and that is himself. He is a smart, brave man who communicates the challenge, frustration, loneliness and danger of royal life, and depicts the ways he continuously chose to put himself and his family first. What an incredibly hard journey, and I wish his family well.

Rating 3 out of 5,"Spare has the benefit of a very talented ghost writer, which did wonders for weaving together the story. It started off strong - the initial reflections of Diana’s death, Harry’s childhood, and his grief were powerful and poignant. It set the tone for a heartfelt story about grief and loss; and the kinds of pain that never leave you. However my interest in the book started to wane throughout, piqued a little when Harry and Meghan meet. Mostly because I really like Meghan. The book drags on a lot - plenty of tedium, and uncomfortably personal stories about Royal Appendages, interspersed with some eye opening & shocking stories. This book was the exact kind of book the term “tell-all” was created. Putting aside the (large) parts of the story that made me think “maybe we don’t need to know that much about each other”, there was obviously a lot of pain here, and a lot of anger - and I think I was expecting a bit more self reflection or growth, but I think any chance of that kind of healing and accountability was lost in the pain and the mess. To be clear, I love mess too, but when you’re such a high profile figure and you have the privilege of perhaps one of the largest platforms to ever have existed, I had hoped for ✨more✨. Especially when Harry and Meghan have been pretty vocal about racism in the media and the press, while saying very little about the racist colonial legacy of the monarchy… I thought this would be addressed in more than two or three throwaway lines. In fact, after all of the comments about the ways the press dehumanized and inflicted pain upon Harry, his family, and the people in their orbit - for Harry to turn around and employ those same dehumanizing techniques on Afghan people without any reflection was pretty dissonant. In fact all of his chapters set during his time as a soldier were very hard to get through. I have a lot of sympathy for Meghan. I also have sympathy for Harry - the Royal institution is cold, stuffy, hostile & outdated. I have empathy for children in that environment. My God, if the various arguments about the waste of resources, and the legacy of colonialism, racism & violence weren’t enough - a depiction of a young grieving child, who was unable to hug his grandmother out of propriety & custom - would be enough to turn your sentiments against the monarchy as an institution.The book isn’t groundbreaking. It’s not horrible either, but is at times insufferable - because even though Harry’s experiences with mental illness, grief, loss, and being hounded and belittled by the press are AWFUL, it was hard to be sympathetic when he shared stories with little to know accountability or reflection of decisions he made on his own.

Rating 3 out of 5,"Big yikes. I really don't even want to rate it. I also don't want to mock it just because. Before I get into a few details, Reasons to listen to this: the prince is a really, really good narrator; it is simple and smooth sailing chapter-wise; many things that he shares are of course interesting, it is a perspective that is completely unique in the world and I won't argue that there isn't value in that; events that everybody would have heard of have not been left out, it's all there. Reasons not to: there are some parts where the eyerolls will physically hurt; there are many, many parts where he shares things that throw massive shade on people who honestly cannot tell their side of the story. The hypocrisy is unbelievable in this sense - the main message is that the media destroyed his life through depriving him of privacy. But this book is also a huge invasion of privacy for his family. So it's a mixed bag and I feel a bit dirty after having played along. My favourite parts were about his boyhood, Botswana, Australia and the army. And actually his past attempts at relationships as well. The romance section at the end with his now wife was too much for me, but I also hate romance anyway. I think that he probably does believe that everything he says is true. Is it the objective truth? Doubtful. Even in the book itself there were various scenes where he accuses his brother of being distant or whatever, and then glosses over parts where he obviously acted the same way. Harry generally comes across in a surprisingly positive way (even for an autobiography). But maybe less so when he described having to sleep (shudder) in a smaller bedroom in a distant corner of some castle. Or when he said something super deep and William ""said nothing."" Or whenever royal poverty was mentioned. Or the very obvious question of, you know, the monarchy. I am a closet royalist, but even for me, there was some cringe. In conclusion, there is not enough therapy in the world to help all these people, god save the royals 🤷‍♀️Show more",3,Big yikes I really dont even want to rate it I also dont want to mock it just because Before I get into a few details Reasons to listen to this the prince is a really really good narrator it is simple and smooth sailing chapterwise many things that he shares are of course interesting it is a perspective that is completely unique in the world and I wont argue that there isnt value in that events that everybody would have heard of have not been left out its all there Reasons not to there are some parts where the eyerolls will physically hurt there are many many parts where he shares things that throw massive shade on people who honestly cannot tell their side of the story The hypocrisy is unbelievable in this sense  the main message is that the media destroyed his life through depriving him of privacy But this book is also a huge invasion of privacy for his family So its a mixed bag and I feel a bit dirty after having played along My favourite parts were about his boyhood Botswana Australia and the army And actually his past attempts at relationships as well The romance section at the end with his now wife was too much for me but I also hate romance anyway I think that he probably does believe that everything he says is true Is it the objective truth Doubtful Even in the book itself there were various scenes where he accuses his brother of being distant or whatever and then glosses over parts where he obviously acted the same way Harry generally comes across in a surprisingly positive way even for an autobiography But maybe less so when he described having to sleep shudder in a smaller bedroom in a distant corner of some castle Or when he said something super deep and William said nothing Or whenever royal poverty was mentioned Or the very obvious question of you know the monarchy I am a closet royalist but even for me there was some cringe In conclusion there is not enough therapy in the world to help all these people god save the royals Show more
Rating 5 out of 5,"This book is fascinating and I could hardly put it down. I’ve read many of the biographies of the Queen and other royals but this is a chance to read a royal’s own words. Yes it is one sided. But it is his story to tell. The book is broken into three sections: 1) his mothers death, education and going into the military, 2) military career and post military years, 3) Meghan, meeting, dating and their life together. He talks about specific stories that I’ve always believed as fact because no one disputed them and how inaccurate they are. He also admits to a lot of drinking and drug use that I was less aware of as an adult. I was shocked at small things like he only once has been in his grandmothers bedroom (they were picking out a tiara for the wedding). The petty jealousy of Charles and the image rehabilitation for Camilla has been documented and addressed in other biographies. I didn’t realize it was at the expense of leaking stories about William and Harry to put the glare on them. I’ve never been a fan of King Charles or Camilla. And I’m surprised at how loving Harry can write about his father knowing at the same time there is ultimately betrayal by falling back on the excuse that this is the way it is done. Of course his constant source of irritation is the press and paparazzi. Honestly it makes you wonder if there shouldn’t be tightening of libel laws for private and public figures. As this book has come out I’ve made the conscious choice not to fall for the click bait or stories that only have a “close source” as the base. I can accept there can be inaccuracies and different views of the same event. My brother and I can’t agree on events surrounding the day our grandparents died in a car accident. We have differing memories. I am fully team Meghan and am appalled at what the press and royals put her through. I wish Harry and his family a happy and long life. I wish the same for William and Catherine. And I hope for some karma to smack Charles and Camilla up side the head.

He has a more free spirited type of personality, while his dad and brother are quiet and reserved. So parts of this book had me scratching my head. He was drinking and doing drugs in school, so why say the press lied? He picked out the Nazi costume thinking it was funny, why was he surprised at the backlash? He chose to party in Vegas, have a party in his room and play strip pool. He never really thinks about what he is doing and the consequences. Dating was the same. I wonder if some of the break ups were because he was wild?

Rating 5 out of 5,"For me, this wasn’t a 5 star read. But I’m rating it 5 stars because of all of the assholes who rated it 1 star before release.A book that needs zero introduction, so let’s dive right in!I found parts 1&2 to be much more interesting than part 3 (which was basically the Netflix doc). Part 1 started with the death of Diana and how that shaped his childhood and teen years. Part 2 focused on finding purpose in the military, which he is obviously very proud of. I read the physical book and I wasn’t crazy about (I know he used a super famous ghost writer) how the sentences/paragraphs were structured. I think this would have translated much better on audio, where it would feel more conversational, and where the breaks in paragraphs wouldn’t annoy me. Overall I liked this, but didn’t love.I didn’t pay much attention to the the sensational headlines of the leaked material because I figured they were taken out of context. And I was correct. If you’re someone who honestly believed he was bragging about his military kills, then you just help prove his point when it comes to the media. Look, this is a memoir. This is his side, how he perceives what happened throughout his life, this is all his memory. You don’t have to like him, you don’t have to read the book, but he has every right to publish his story. Imagine this: your whole life, you have never been able to speak for yourself or defend yourself. You belong to the people. Add to that, severe trauma from the death of your mother. And this isn’t like choosing to be famous, you literally had zero choice from the day you were born. There has to be something incredibly liberating and cathartic from writing a book like this, so to that I say, do your damn thing.

Rating 4 out of 5,"When it comes to controversial memoirs that spark lots of internet listicles called ""Top Ten Most Salacious Things We Learned from Prince Harry's Autobiography,"" I have to admit - I'm not looking for beautifully crafted paragraphs that sweep me away in literary ecstasy. Mostly, I want the tea.The question I have for myself when I finish books like these, is, ""Am I glad I read it?"" And in this case, I am. Yes, it's completely, 100% from Harry's perspective, but it never pretends to be anything else. Do King Charles and Prince William likely have different versions of these same events? Undoubtedly. (And do they come off as awful people you wouldn't want to befriend? Also yes.)The other question I had while listening, was ""how much sympathy can I really have for a literal prince?"" And the answer was, enough. Yes, he's led an incredibly privileged life. And yet, the phrase ""gilded cage"" seems very apt (he uses it frequently in his book). He was literally born into a role he neither wanted nor seemed well-suited for. While he always had a place to stay and food on the table (and more than that - palaces to vacation in, famous friends who open their secured estates to you in a pinch, servants, etc.), he also had very limited options as to what he wanted to do with his life. If his book is to be believed (and I generally believe it), he was either accepting of that role or it never actually occurred to him that he could quit until he met the woman he loved, and watched the press try to destroy her (with more than a little help from ""Willy"" and ""Pa"").Are there victims of worse crimes in the world? Sure. And yet, that doesn't minimize the pain that others experience, nor should it diminish our empathy. When your family essentially gives you no other choice but to cut ties with them completely, that's painful - no matter the size of your bank account. And -- the book isn't all pain, sorrow, and complaining. Prince Harry doesn't whine, but does his level best to present facts and include the good with the bad: his pride at being a soldier, the love he had for his mother, his romance with his Duchess, even his first dog.And yes, the frostbitten todger. Honestly, I think he just enjoyed telling a salacious story that the press never got to tell for him. It was a scoop more than anything else.

Rating 5 out of 5,"You shouldn't be able to rate or make an opinion on this book without reading it! (I have read it all today) The media have taken soundbites from this book and spun them out of context which is making everyone angry and twisting his narrative. He isn't hating on the Royal Family, he is hating the media and what it has done to his life so no wonder the media are spinning it. He is angry that he could not control his narrative when it came to the press so now this is his opportunity to speak the truth of his life. This book is largely about Harry condemning the tabloid press for the disgusting way they have treated him and the Royal Family. He is angry about the way the Royal Family just have to be complicit in their relationship with the media, he wanted to fight back and protect his family. Harry, The Spare, is always destined to live in the shadow of his brother and ultimately the sacrificial lamb for the media - ""who cares he won't be King lets rip him to bits"". The death of his mother at age 12, and having to deal with that in the public eye arguably as one of the most famous men on the planet, has clearly damaged him and he has carried those emotional and psychological wounds for years. I think he is still deeply traumatized and tried to reach out to his family for help but for whatever reason was rejected. It sounds like William and Charles have been and are dealing with their own shit with the media so perhaps they see it as Harry dealing with it as well is just part of it. Focused on their own traumas. Harry alludes to the fact William has plenty of grievances with royal protocol and the media but he has to be complicit and was sometimes jealous of Harry when he was allowed to do something that he wasn't (Beardgate) There are lots of funny and heartwarming anecdotes, he was just a human trying to find his way in life all under the watchful eyes of the media and the world - it must have been insane. I back him writing this. He perhaps should haven't put the Taliban bounty on his head but I guess he wanted to acknowledge that was part of who he is and what he has done.

Rating 4 out of 5,"This book is an important piece of history, because monarchies have been around for centuries and they are a seemingly dying concept, although we still have a lot of ideation and fascination about them. Here we can insight into a human, overly personal account of someone living, in Harry's own words, in a ""fishbowl,"" trapped with everybody watching from the outside; never able to escape.I think it's crucially important for readers to understand how difficult it would be to understand this incredibly weird and unique childhood filled with paparazzi, under the critical eye of the world. How rare for anyone to experience that. Only in recent have we had photography and mass media as we do now, and combine that with the fascination royalty and what unique and challenging world for a child to grow up in. As far as anything malicious, I see none of that - the hate garnered from people seems to be stemming from something inside themselves, rather than Harry (or Meghan). From what I read, Harry seems observant, kind, and maybe a bit too open and a bit petty sometimes, albeit somewhat funny (William's ""alarming"" hair loss seems to bit a swipe at a lifetime of feeling belitted by his older brother). The openness in the book, although criticized, was honestly refreshing. In this modern time of social media's focus on our life highlights and our idealism of perfection, it made him relatable and transparent.I do think Harry has some maturing to do and a lot of trauma to deal with. Wealth and fame do not make up for people's trauma, although does alleviate a lot of the harshness in life, but can still come with a unique set of implications. I think it would scary and difficult to be so open and share this kind of detailed account, so I applaud his bravery in doing so.Show more",4,This book is an important piece of history because monarchies have been around for centuries and they are a seemingly dying concept although we still have a lot of ideation and fascination about them Here we can insight into a human overly personal account of someone living in Harrys own words in a fishbowl trapped with everybody watching from the outside never able to escapeI think its crucially important for readers to understand how difficult it would be to understand this incredibly weird and unique childhood filled with paparazzi under the critical eye of the world How rare for anyone to experience that Only in recent have we had photography and mass media as we do now and combine that with the fascination royalty and what unique and challenging world for a child to grow up in As far as anything malicious I see none of that  the hate garnered from people seems to be stemming from something inside themselves rather than Harry or Meghan From what I read Harry seems observant kind and maybe a bit too open and a bit petty sometimes albeit somewhat funny Williams alarming hair loss seems to bit a swipe at a lifetime of feeling belitted by his older brother The openness in the book although criticized was honestly refreshing In this modern time of social medias focus on our life highlights and our idealism of perfection it made him relatable and transparentI do think Harry has some maturing to do and a lot of trauma to deal with Wealth and fame do not make up for peoples trauma although does alleviate a lot of the harshness in life but can still come with a unique set of implications I think it would scary and difficult to be so open and share this kind of detailed account so I applaud his bravery in doing soShow more
Rating 4 out of 5,"It took me 3 whole weeks to finish this book. It's loaded with storylines, names, details that at times become overwhelming and you need to take a break from it. I was conflicted along the way, I couldn't decide if Harry's side of the story was the real one or if it was greatly embellished. There were lots of cringe moments, especially when he talked in such a negative way about his own brother and sister-in-law, and at times it seemed a bit stretched to say the least. In the end, I took a step back and tried to imagine myself in his shoes: being hunted his whole life by the media, not getting a moment of peace and privacy, being banished by his own family and left on his own in the world without any real skills or support. People say that he's a hypocrite for writing a book where he spills the tea on all the royal family members and for giving interviews or doing docuseries, and getting rich by doing it. After all, if all of a sudden you found yourself without a job and without any valuable skills to sell, would you say no to an opportunity like that and put in danger the wellbeing of your own children and wife by not being able to afford not even security?

Rating 4 out of 5,"I'm going to begin with some general comments, then move to specifics about the book:First, I don't know how anyone in the U.S. could possibly understand, ever, the depths to which the British press invade the Royal Family's privacy. Phone hacking, outright lies, bounties (up to $100,000 for a single picture at times), illegally obtained emails, and so much more--we have issues in our media, but nothing to that extent. No one in this country garners that much attention (perhaps until Harry and Meghan arrived). If even half of what Harry says is true, it's still a really depraved system with no checks on the ""paps,"" as he calls them. And, of course, he has every right to be wary if not downright terrified of the paps--they killed his mother. He provides detail after detail after detail about how the press went after him and everyone he came in contact with, and then their contacts--girlfriends' families were harassed, their families' lives investigated and reported, and no one in Harry's orbit was spared. It is awful and there's just no way to prepare for that. Harry shares how many in his life couldn't or wouldn't deal with it--relationships ended, people stayed away, and it really struck me how isolating it must have been, especially when he found out that his family--namely, Camilla and then Charles--traded info about Harry for positive headlines.Regardless of what you think about the RF or monarchies in general, Harry has been treated poorly. His family--every single member--was complicit in making his and Meghan's lives miserable. He begged them repeatedly to stand up for her, and no one would. Harry had to have every purchase, every event, every aspect of his life approved and monitored, which led to conflicts with his brother. William was constantly fearful that Harry, who is usually the most popular royal, would outshine him and/or garner more positive press. How sad that William constantly felt competition with his own brother, when Harry never intended on competing in the first place.In terms of the book, the press is the villain here. And anyone who's been on Twitter over the last few years has probably seen side-by-side examples of the treatment Kate and Meghan have gotten. Kate is praised for lovingly stroking her baby bump, while Meghan is both criticized for the same and accused of faking her first pregnancy outright (Google #moonbump if you don't believe me). A recently resurfaced headline criticized Meghan for having her hands in her pockets--many Twitter users were quick to post pics of the Queen, Kate, William, Harry, and Charles with their hands in their pockets without a word from anyone. And there are others. Meghan could do nothing right, and what what seemed most egregious to Harry is that many of her actions were sanctioned and approved of by the Firm. The press, unaware of that, turned her so-called gaffes or ""faux paus"" into something insidious, like undermining the Queen or being disrespectful. Harry was systematically shut out of his family. His life was in jeopardy constantly, as was Meghan's. They had unprecedented hate mail and threats against them--snipers were present at their wedding, as were bomb-sniffing dogs, to prevent anything. It's heartbreaking to see the Firm so casually disregard their safety by pulling security and breaking their own promises.Think what you want about Harry, but he genuinely seems to love Meghan. They just want to be free to be a family in private, or at least choose the time and place and circumstances of what they want to disclose. And, he was constantly grieving his mother--that was difficult to read, too, because he needed help and no one recognized it until an ex girlfriend when he was an adult.

Never complain, never explain.

Well... What to say about the book that took 2023 by storm? Do I hate it? Definitely not. Do I love it? I could love it, but no.It's hard to review it. I have been on team William & Kate as long as I can remember. I have always admired them, her especially. Her beauty, her grace, her poise. But if half of what is written in the book is true, shame on them. Not just the couple. All of them, the family, the institution.The part I like the most is Harry meeting Meghan, and the way he describes everything, her. He seems genuinely in love with her. I hope their love lasts. If not, his leaving the monarchy... what was it for? If the happiness H writes about with her is real, that is all that matter in the end.Another thing I like about the book is that Harry is living my dream: exposing all the dirty little secrets of the family, telling his truth, letting his voice be heard. I am no celebrity, yet I have always thought it cathartic to be able to spill your guts, bare it all. This is me. I have been abused. See me.
What was the universe out to prove by taking my penis at the same moment it took my brother?
Then again, reading about a prince talking about his penis continuously felt a bit much sometimes. I could have skipped that part. Also, does the book read like a movie script to anyone else? The short sentences, the description for the scene... I can see the book turning into a movie or series.My advice is to take everything with a grain of salt. This is Harry's version of the truth. It doesn't mean it's right or wrong. It's what he believes or wishes to be the truth. If you keep that in mind and you like the British Royal Family, Spare can be a good read.Show more",3,"Never complain never explain

Rating 3 out of 5,"I've never been much of a royal fan and didn't know much about them, but I was intrigued by the documentary about Meghan and Harry, with whom I have a lot of sympathy. I've even watched The Crown, a fantastic show; late to the party, I know. And, of course, I was 12 when Princess Di died in 1997, and I still remember our family gathering around the television for once.Prince Harry's memoir was immediately declared ""the fastest-selling non-fiction book of all time"", but the content itself doesn't justify the hype. It may be a document of contemporary history, but mostly it is a rather dull one. I didn't care much for the 'war stories'. I was shocked by sentences like ""There's room for both of you (William and Harry) in Africa"", as if ""Africa"" were just a little toy for British royals to play with (by the way, ""Africa"" is not a country, but a continent). The most interesting aspects of Harry's story have either already been told in the documentary or are treated rather superficially. Spare doesn't draw any very profound conclusions, but it may manage to elicit some empathy from readers who don't think they already know everything.

We all know, in one way or another, the Monarch operates differently. We also know that the British people may have mistreated Megan.

That being said, I really want to know what Prince William has to say to any of the accusations. I wonder if his recollection of events differ from Prince Harry's. The book solely shows one side's story. I am pretty sure he is not as innocent as he described himself.

I read this book after a couple of other books about Harry and his extended family...brother, father, grandmother and their spouses.

I am so glad that I am no longer considered British despite being born and raised in England. I feel ashamed of the British press and their horrendous tactics. Anything for a story. I am also saddened that Harry's father, brother, grandmother and others allowed the press to get away with these stories and even fed them with leads. I am very glad to know that Harry, his wife and his children are in a places where they feel safe and protected.

Rating 4 out of 5,"Highly recommend reading this book to anyone that enjoys memoirs, learning about British culture/the Royals, likes Harry/Meg, and/or is looking for an easy, entertaining, thoughtful read. My knowledge of the Royal family, like many Americans, comes from tv shows like the Crown and watching media coverage surrounding big historic and tragic events. I do not read tabloids and other than what I heard during Harry and Meg's interview with Oprah (and now read in this book), I was largely unaware of Prince Harry's past (and treatment by British press) and knew little about how they unfairly treated Meg. I've been to London once, but as an American didn't fully appreciate the obsession with the Royal family, and still do not. I watched Suits regularly back when we had cable tv, and stopped when Meg left the show which just happened to coincide with when we decided to get rid of Cable. I loved Meg's character on the show and knew a little bit about her involvement in speaking out for gender equality and her work with the UN. All this is to say - going into this book, I did not know a lot about their life together or their personal backgrounds. I found this book to be highly entertaining, informative, and interesting. I learned a lot about Prince Harry's life and listening to him read his own words was powerful. It seems clear to me that his strained relationship with members of the institution and the press was apparent well before Meg ever entered the scene. His values and beliefs had clearly been shaped well before her presence in his life and any suggestion by media that she is the sole cause of his departure is laughable. Listening to his book, it is quite clear that he is a strong willed and capable of independent thought. I respect his decision to put his family first, and I think it is sad that the institution was so unwilling to come to some sort of compromise. They most certainly lost an opportunity with Meg, and I look forward to see what she does in the future for women as she hopefully continues the work she started decades ago, speaking out against gender equality.Show more",4,Highly recommend reading this book to anyone that enjoys memoirs learning about British culturethe Royals likes HarryMeg andor is looking for an easy entertaining thoughtful read My knowledge of the Royal family like many Americans comes from tv shows like the Crown and watching media coverage surrounding big historic and tragic events I do not read tabloids and other than what I heard during Harry and Megs interview with Oprah and now read in this book I was largely unaware of Prince Harrys past and treatment by British press and knew little about how they unfairly treated Meg Ive been to London once but as an American didnt fully appreciate the obsession with the Royal family and still do not I watched Suits regularly back when we had cable tv and stopped when Meg left the show which just happened to coincide with when we decided to get rid of Cable I loved Megs character on the show and knew a little bit about her involvement in speaking out for gender equality and her work with the UN All this is to say  going into this book I did not know a lot about their life together or their personal backgrounds I found this book to be highly entertaining informative and interesting I learned a lot about Prince Harrys life and listening to him read his own words was powerful It seems clear to me that his strained relationship with members of the institution and the press was apparent well before Meg ever entered the scene His values and beliefs had clearly been shaped well before her presence in his life and any suggestion by media that she is the sole cause of his departure is laughable Listening to his book it is quite clear that he is a strong willed and capable of independent thought I respect his decision to put his family first and I think it is sad that the institution was so unwilling to come to some sort of compromise They most certainly lost an opportunity with Meg and I look forward to see what she does in the future for women as she hopefully continues the work she started decades ago speaking out against gender equalityShow more
Rating 4 out of 5,"I started reading the hard copy of this book but immediately switched to the Audible version and loved that Harry voiced the book himself. The first section of this book was incredibly difficult to listen to. A searingly cathartic telling of the traumatic loss of his mother and all that followed. Essentially, the loss of any semblance of “family” as all remaining royals valued protocol and institution over family and affection. The dysfunction, egos, and competition throughout the family was both difficult to understand and heartbreaking to hear. A consistent theme throughout was the voice of a broken, twelve year old little boy desperate for the love and presence of his mother. The war section left some to be desired in terms of opportunities to speak up and out. The details given to some stories were almost too thorough, where others were simply glossed over. Again, the voice of a little boy desperately seeking approval, affection, and acceptance rang throughout. Having sought love and never seeming to put all the cards together, he meets Meg. And the press obliterates her. Now, we hear that Camilla and his own family were responsible for much of the leaked information as their status in the press trumped all others. The racial slurs are abhorrent. The comments in almost any given social media post about Meghan clearly illustrate the claims Harry and Meghan make about the press: often full of hate, bandwagon keyboard warrior-ing, and sheer racist ignorance. It is clear that tabloid press type media needs to reconcile its presence with the humanity of those on which they prey. Overall, enjoyable listen. Surprised such an antiquated institution still exists…did not enjoy the rigidity and coldness of “royal protocol”.Show more",4,I started reading the hard copy of this book but immediately switched to the Audible version and loved that Harry voiced the book himself The first section of this book was incredibly difficult to listen to A searingly cathartic telling of the traumatic loss of his mother and all that followed Essentially the loss of any semblance of family as all remaining royals valued protocol and institution over family and affection The dysfunction egos and competition throughout the family was both difficult to understand and heartbreaking to hear A consistent theme throughout was the voice of a broken twelve year old little boy desperate for the love and presence of his mother The war section left some to be desired in terms of opportunities to speak up and out The details given to some stories were almost too thorough where others were simply glossed over Again the voice of a little boy desperately seeking approval affection and acceptance rang throughout Having sought love and never seeming to put all the cards together he meets Meg And the press obliterates her Now we hear that Camilla and his own family were responsible for much of the leaked information as their status in the press trumped all others The racial slurs are abhorrent The comments in almost any given social media post about Meghan clearly illustrate the claims Harry and Meghan make about the press often full of hate bandwagon keyboard warrioring and sheer racist ignorance It is clear that tabloid press type media needs to reconcile its presence with the humanity of those on which they prey Overall enjoyable listen Surprised such an antiquated institution still existsdid not enjoy the rigidity and coldness of royal protocolShow more

Rating 5 out of 5,"I had read that some people thought this memoir whiny, but for me it was a soul-searching and heartfelt look at a challenging life--not financially, of course, but in so many other ways. The persistence of the paparazzi is shocking, and the lies and racism condoned by the British tabloids foreshadow some of the lies other Murdoch endeavors have perpetrated (looking at you, Fox News) in the USA. Certainly Harry led outwardly a life of privilege, but the loss of Diana's kindness and warmth changed him immensely. An indifferent student, he found his niche in the military, but was severely restricted due to his royal status. He had two lovely girlfriends before Meghan, but the stress of paparazzi pursuit of not only the women but also their families was just overwhelming. Harry's challenging of tradition was apparently too much for the now King Charles and his heir-apparent, William--ostensibly, there is really no room for dissent or change in the British monarchy.

I fall asleep while listening to some part of it, since it just sounds like listening to a teen-ager throwing a tantrum and blaming everyone so he could feel better about his life.The part where he talk about Megan sounds so much like a fiction that I can't believe it's completely the truth, he make it sound like Megan is just a one dimensional character Overall it's okay, Harry sound like a likeable person but need a better therapy.

Rating 2 out of 5,"This book would be better if they changed the title and premise to reflect the main theme of the book which is his journey not as a “spare” but as a victim of the media. This book basically takes the top controversial stories through the years of Prince Harry and says what look this was the reality. If the book had been more branded in this direction then I’d give it 4 to 5 stars because you can see just how much he has suffered from losing his mother, affecting the military career that he’s proud of, to his relationship with Meghan. The book hardly touches on royal life in the way that only an insider could give us knowledge into. Sure do we get little snippets? Yes but it’s not enough especially considering the book is called Spare. What I liked about this book1. The journey of how the paps have affected his life2. The small snippets of his royal relations and stories of Diana, The Queen, King CharlesWhat I didn’t like1. The fact that the book was very general. For a 400 page book, it really could be cut in half and we could get the same story. Parts 1 and 2 were super general with an oddly specific story that typically wasn’t needed (example I didn’t need nor wanted to know so much about his penis) 2. Part 3 with Meghan is where the book comes to life. I can see why many thought she had a hand in that section because it’s where Harry becomes more real. There are a lot of little specific moments about their relationship. The one problem I had was that they talk about how much more hate she gets and I’d have loved a better comparison of how it affected his prior romantic relationships. This though isn’t so much a negative but more of a I’d like to see this brought more into the front since in parts 1-2 his relationships are only very briefly mentioned3. His relationship with Prince William. It doesn’t come off well for Harry and more positive stories could then be used to truly show just how bad/unhealthy it became 4. The lack of the royal family, and the actual way he grew up. We see bits of it but not a full story. I suspect it’s to try and show that hey I could do worse and have exposed it all but I didn’t 5. The lack of Diana. The book starts when he’s 12 almost 13 and she’s just died. I’d have liked a small section on his early years. Sure she’s a main character throughout his life but it’s her death that’s hanging over him. I’d have liked some of those early more pure child memories Overall it’s a decent book. You really don’t learn that much that you couldn’t find elsewhere.

Rating 3 out of 5,"I am, by no means, an expert about the royal family. I take my interest in it mainly because, whether we like it or not, they serve an important role for the world history. And that is something I absolutely love. Nevertheless, I keep myself updated with a lot of royal family topics, so I’d say I know a few things.Right from the beginning of this book you can tell it’s going to be a painful and honest (at least in Harry’s pov) road. I say Harry’s pov because there is always more sides to one story and because I didn’t live these experiences first hand, nor am I an active part of such experiences, you can’t ever know for sure who is “right” or “wrong”. You might drew your own conclusions based on what’s known to the public (as I did) but still, you’re never certain. Obviously, he never truly healed and grieved for his mom. I believe this is no surprise, considering his environment and responsibilities from such a young age, but still to this day, it’s something that deeply marked in his life and molded his personality. I feel really sorry for him. ALSO!!! Call me dumb but when I realized why the book title was SPARE… I never stopped for a second to actually think of it until it was mentioned in the book. I will be honest with you. There are a lot of chapters on this book that are really boring. I was just so ready to finish it a lot of times. But anyways, this book makes me clearly think that Prince Harry needs to somehow move on from all that is making me stuck in past and remorseful of his path. It’s good that he is getting help and hopefully he will be truly happy someday.Show more",3,I am by no means an expert about the royal family I take my interest in it mainly because whether we like it or not they serve an important role for the world history And that is something I absolutely love Nevertheless I keep myself updated with a lot of royal family topics so Id say I know a few thingsRight from the beginning of this book you can tell its going to be a painful and honest at least in Harrys pov road I say Harrys pov because there is always more sides to one story and because I didnt live these experiences first hand nor am I an active part of such experiences you cant ever know for sure who is right or wrong You might drew your own conclusions based on whats known to the public as I did but still youre never certain Obviously he never truly healed and grieved for his mom I believe this is no surprise considering his environment and responsibilities from such a young age but still to this day its something that deeply marked in his life and molded his personality I feel really sorry for him ALSO Call me dumb but when I realized why the book title was SPARE I never stopped for a second to actually think of it until it was mentioned in the book I will be honest with you There are a lot of chapters on this book that are really boring I was just so ready to finish it a lot of times But anyways this book makes me clearly think that Prince Harry needs to somehow move on from all that is making me stuck in past and remorseful of his path Its good that he is getting help and hopefully he will be truly happy somedayShow more
Rating 5 out of 5,"I am a royal apologist, an Anglophile, an avid monarchy information consumer. So all my thoughts of Harry’s story (and it is HIS story) are colored by my bias that way, but I have to say that this is one walloping, gut-wrenching, captivating story that puts so much into perspective, that pulls back the veil of years of decorum and silence, and paints a picture of a man trying to put back together the pieces of a fractured life in the best way he can.First, I’ve heard a lot of praise for the ghostwriter, and I’ll add my own. This book is laid out so well (the section headings as lines from the “Invictus” poem? A nod to the Games that Harry championed and are so near to his heart? Chef’s kiss.) and brings you right along the arc of Harry’s life, bookended by his visit back to London after Queen Elizabeth’s death. I loved hearing about his time in the military and his passion for African countries and charities. It humanized him and helped us to understand his strong sense of PTSD that bleeds into other areas of his life. Of course his mother’s death at such an impactful age marked him for life (he won’t even call it her death, instead referring to his as her “disappearance”, which says loads of how he processed it back then), and he holds nothing back when comparing the media hounding and paparazzi coverage of Diana, which directly led to her death, to the blatant racism and abuse Meghan and he suffered by the same entities. If you haven’t watched the Netflix documentary about them, it’s fascinating and maddening to see the media comparison of Meghan to literally any other royal.It seems all his life was about escaping and running from difficulty and tragedy, and meeting Meghan finally felt like the relief he was always searching for. I’ll admit my opinions have changed a bit regarding “Willy”, Catherine, Charles, and Camilla (though he never says one unkind or suggestive word about the Queen). In my opinion, he does not come across as petulant or “whinging”, but tells his truth, which has gone unspoken for so long. Others have told their version of his truth, so now it’s time for him to set it straight. I don’t begrudge him a word of this memoir, and while there may be other sides to the stories and other ways of remembering events, I hold with Harry for how much of the sad state of affairs has gone down. “I love my mother country, and I love my family. And I always will. I just wish, at the second darkest moment of my life, that they were there for me. And I think when they look back, they will wish it too.”Yes, he wishes the media would leave him alone but still hawks his story to anyone who will listen. But the points he makes about the double (even triple and quadruple) standards among royals, the media, in his own family are things that need to be brought to light. He’s always been the “black sheep” and the “spare”, but now he can breathe a little easier without the weight of the Crown on his shoulders.Show more",5,I am a royal apologist an Anglophile an avid monarchy information consumer So all my thoughts of Harrys story and it is HIS story are colored by my bias that way but I have to say that this is one walloping gutwrenching captivating story that puts so much into perspective that pulls back the veil of years of decorum and silence and paints a picture of a man trying to put back together the pieces of a fractured life in the best way he canFirst Ive heard a lot of praise for the ghostwriter and Ill add my own This book is laid out so well the section headings as lines from the Invictus poem A nod to the Games that Harry championed and are so near to his heart Chefs kiss and brings you right along the arc of Harrys life bookended by his visit back to London after Queen Elizabeths death I loved hearing about his time in the military and his passion for African countries and charities It humanized him and helped us to understand his strong sense of PTSD that bleeds into other areas of his life Of course his mothers death at such an impactful age marked him for life he wont even call it her death instead referring to his as her disappearance which says loads of how he processed it back then and he holds nothing back when comparing the media hounding and paparazzi coverage of Diana which directly led to her death to the blatant racism and abuse Meghan and he suffered by the same entities If you havent watched the Netflix documentary about them its fascinating and maddening to see the media comparison of Meghan to literally any other royalIt seems all his life was about escaping and running from difficulty and tragedy and meeting Meghan finally felt like the relief he was always searching for Ill admit my opinions have changed a bit regarding Willy Catherine Charles and Camilla though he never says one unkind or suggestive word about the Queen In my opinion he does not come across as petulant or whinging but tells his truth which has gone unspoken for so long Others have told their version of his truth so now its time for him to set it straight I dont begrudge him a word of this memoir and while there may be other sides to the stories and other ways of remembering events I hold with Harry for how much of the sad state of affairs has gone down I love my mother country and I love my family And I always will I just wish at the second darkest moment of my life that they were there for me And I think when they look back they will wish it tooYes he wishes the media would leave him alone but still hawks his story to anyone who will listen But the points he makes about the double even triple and quadruple standards among royals the media in his own family are things that need to be brought to light Hes always been the black sheep and the spare but now he can breathe a little easier without the weight of the Crown on his shouldersShow more
Rating 4 out of 5,"I found this book to be very tastefully done. I’ve always been interested in the royal family and once Princess Di entered the picture my interest grew. I enjoyed learning of Harry’s childhood, memories he shared of his mummy, the PTSD and anxiety he battles from her death, and relationships with Pa, Willy and his grandparents. He also talks of his service in Afghanistan. After listening to the Audible and reading the book I found Harry to be much like the Peoples Princess. He’s kind, sensitive, has a wicked sense of humor and doesn’t take himself too seriously. He continues in the charitable work his mum started.The British monarchy is very complex, and the paparazzi are a pain in the ass and dangerous.He loves his family in England and I feel the choices he made were justified. Some were forced on him.He loves his wife “Meg” and his son and daughter. I’ve always been a Harry fan. He and his granny had a special relationship and shared secrets.

Rating 4 out of 5,"Probably more of a 3.5 but I’m rounding up. I may be anti-monarchy as an institution but I’m also one of many who was fascinated by Princess Diana, so I was definitely very interested to read this book. Meghan and Harry’s Netflix documentary had also primed me for this. And while there are parts from the documentary which are told here again and it can get repetitive, but there’s also a lot of new information. I guess most of it just felt very surprising because the royal family, their dynamics, the way they do things, what they believe in - it almost feels like they aren’t from our world and there were many instances where I felt incredulous. The middle portion of the memoir which is about Harry’s experiences in the military and the war made me a lot uncomfortable, and I’m frankly astonished he was so candid about everything. This is definitely a book which felt like he was venting everything that he had never been able to talk about, and all I can hope is that it was therapeutic for him. Reading it may feel a bit tedious though, because it’s very stream of consciousness style of writing and the chapters sometimes were very small and ended abruptly. But he narrates the audiobook himself and that was definitely a better way to consume this memoir. I’m definitely feeling quite sympathetic towards him after finishing this and I can only hope he can find peace in his life in America, away from the fish bowl.

Rating 4 out of 5,"There's something deeply satisfying in watching the self righteous anger, hatred, and hypocrisy over this book unfold in real time. Everyone seems to want Harry and Meghan to Just. Shut. Up. But they hastily click on every article with the titillating takeaways from his memoir. They want to watch the media excoriate him for daring to tell his own story when the media chased his mother to her literal death and made his life a glittering cage. It's only okay if someone else tells his story, huh? I am not suggesting I feel sorry for him. He's privileged in a way most never will be. But his trauma is real, his pain is real, and his book is introspective, thoughtful, and fascinating. So do yourself a favor and actually read it before you decide he's a money grubbing attention whore.

Rating 3 out of 5,"I kind of feel the need to defend why I would read this… even spend money on it 😬 yes, I am against the monarchy and believe that there’s absolutely no reason for one family to be arbitrarily privileged (or even worse, “divinely chosen”), especially in this day and age while millions of their own compatriots struggle to survive. Well, first off, someone else in my household wants to read it. I realised that on a purely gossipy, zeitgeisty level, I wanted to as well. And since my reading year 2023 isn’t getting off to a great start, I thought a page-turner would get the ball rolling.Some of it is interesting. Some of it is shocking. Some of it is cringe. Whatever you think about the whole thing, it’s important for Harry’s voice to be heard (even though multiple TV interviews plus the book is a biiiiit much). The childhood trauma he had to endure in the public eye, and his family’s lack of real support for this, is something none of us will ever understand. The way the royal family and media treated him and Meghan is completely unacceptable. As is the hate she gets for… existing? I just wish they’d understand that they more they try to justify themselves, and make inordinate amounts of money doing it, the more they’ll be ridiculed. And most of all, they still don’t really ""get it"": they still support the monarchy as an institution, and the Commonwealth, thereby upholding the racist imperial structures that they claim to oppose.

Rating 1 out of 5,"I seriously dislike him more and more. Him and his wife should fade from our collective consciousness as soon as possible. When people say “my truth” it smacks of lies. Multiple ""recollections"" in this have been called into question and been proven false. He was with his family in Klosters, Switzerland when the Queen Mother died (photographic evidence) and he couldn't have gotten an Xbox in '97 because they weren't produced until '01. His great-great-great-great-great-great grandfather is not Henry IV as he claims in this as well, Henry IV's line ended when his son Edward died. He also makes a claim that Meghan paid for a New Zealand Air flight from Mexico to the UK for her dad, but the airline has confirmed they offer no such flight. He also says that Meghan wore a black sweater and jeans to their first date, but Meghan stated in the televised interview, when she went to the exhibit where her wedding dress was being displayed, that it contained a scrap of blue fabric from the dress she wore on their first date... Furthermore, he is continues the hypocrisy train he is on by going on shows to promote this book and stating he wants to reconcile with his family in private with assurance nothing he says gets reported all the while including information about private conversations in this book! He and Meghan also sued the Mail on Sunday newspaper for printing a letter with the consent of Meghan's father who was the recipient of the letter; however, Harry publishes text messages between Kate and Meghan in this book. Can you say double standard? On that note, he is writing about Diana's death in this as well but all the other people who have written about their experiences with Diana and her death are the ones milking it for money...again where is his logical reasoning skill? Harry also is now saying in interviews for this book that he never accused the Royal Family of racism and that they aren't racist. He also keeps accusing the Royal family of staying silent and not correcting misinformation. But he allowed his wife to allege, in the Oprah interview, that a member of the Royal family had questioned what skin color their baby would have without providing specific context over what the actual conversation was and very strategically implied they are racist. They also wouldn't ""name names"" because that would be very damaging, but then specifically identified it wasn't the Queen or Prince Philip, but they are aware that this statement implies it was Charles, Camilla, William or Catherine. Meghan manipulated that whole interview and knew that their words and actions would lead most people to make assumptions that if it wasn't the Queen or Philip, then it was likely one of the next four. However, based on Harry's recent statements it seems unlikely it was any of them, or whatever the conversation was didn't have the racist tones Meghan implied in the Oprah interview, but that was very strategic to manipulate the situation on Meghan's part.

If the third chapter was published as an opinion piece/essay, I genuinely think that Harry would have won over public favour.

While Harry’s hatred for the press is woven throughout the entire novel, it was expressed most concisely and eloquently in this section. This section, unfortunately, was not enough to save the book. The first two chapters are wanky and uncomfortable to read. Harry is an immensely unreliable narrator who refuses to acknowledge barely any fault.

Rating 5 out of 5,"I highly recommend the audiobook, read by Harry himself. My overarching thought is that the book provides a compelling and unflinching condemnation of the press and the public that consumes it. And rightly so. The latter half of Part II gets a bit repetitive and disjointed, but otherwise the book is incredibly well written, atmospheric, and evocative. It is easy to stand in his shoes and feel his pain and sense of helplessness, but then also his courage and agency (finally!) in making his escape. Good for him. Even taking things with a grain of salt, as it is very patently a one-sided account here… Willy seems a right wanker, as do Camilla and Charles. One hopes Kate is often able to scamper off to a distant castle on her own. If I were Harry or Meghan, I would be glad to finally be free.Now. Would Harry have written this book had he not been cut off for asking to step back (as he would have had to do anyway when William’s kids come of age)? Probably not. Is he feeding the same beasts he proclaims to loathe by publishing this book? Sure.

What are we doing if we don't have some semblance of the truth?I still stand by my earlier update, but here's an addendum: it's clear that Harry has done a lot of maturing throughout his life, which is obvious in reading this biography.

Rating 4 out of 5,"I am giving this 4 stars. That feels high, but this book was good!This book highlights that Harry's life is the shadow of his mother's death and that there is grief still. It is the very through-line of his story. It also shows how similar Diana and Harry are. Both having the media destroy their life to the point where they feel the need to leave. They also both felt outcasted by the royal family and instead of getting help from them were told they were being paranoid. For as much as I learned and really enjoyed this book, I think I needed to know 10% less. Everything I’ve learned about this man’s “todger” has been against my will.

Rating 4 out of 5,"There are a lot of ways to look at this book. I think I’ll choose to focus on it largely as a book, and not as a chance to judge the actions of a person I have no way of comparing myself to. At least in situation. I say so because I’m already surprised by scanning other reviews how many people say they “would have done X or Y”, unlike Harry and Meghan. I think at this point getting out alive and finding a way to thrive is a win. No further comment needed on that score. As a book:This is well written and the little intimate glimpses of royal life are so rich. The stories of the African continent are really inspiring. And the last few pages of the book are really breathtaking. This book is probably going to be a subject of conversation and argument for a long time. And unfortunately we’re all going to have to hear about it. I think reading this story and spending some time with the questions it tries to ponder are a good move, if you’re even a little curious.

Rating 3 out of 5,"Listen I get that after a lifetime of being slammed by the media Harry wants to defend himself, but 400+ pages of being defensive is not a good memoir. I read this because of the outrage and I don't think it's justified. But then I remembered that the media spreading this outrage is the same media that was calling Meghan racial slurs. I'm glad Harry is standing up for himself and his new family and this is his platform so he can say whatever we wants, but omg this book needed a TEAM of editors, it's so slow paced and repetitive.Harry writes like he's the type of person who makes a 1 sentence anecdote into a 20 minute story. How do you make a story about almost losing your 💫todger💫 in the North Pole and flying your private jet to be the ring bearer at a royal wedding sound boring? I know the royals are not raised to have a personality, but if Harry's writing was a spice, it would be flour.If you love royal drama, Diana, Meghan or Harry, of course, this is a great read for you.

Rating 2 out of 5,"The ONLY instance in which I would recommend this book is if you are in my exact situation: staring down 60+ hours in a car and looking for any way to distract yourself.This was an absolute Rage Listen from start to finish. Just enough completely insipid yet irresistible nuggets of information about the Royal Family that I couldn't give it up, but spent most of the SIXTEEN HOURS wishing I could.While I generally sympathize with the treatment Harry and especially Meghan received and their need/choice to escape that life, this book did nothing to increase that and instead Harry just made me feel that way IN SPITE OF his representation of himself. Harry seems incapable of balancing the privilege and horror of life as a Royal and instead just falls back on infantile responses to most challenges, although he does occasionally come by these honestly. Last note: his ghost writer really did him dirty by allowing him to quote Faulkner and admit he found the quote while pursuing BrainyQuotes.com.

Rating 4 out of 5,"This book is not for everyone but it was 100 million percent for me. My favorite bits were the first half to three quarters of the book when Harry is detailing his life pre-Meghan because so much of that was new information (to me at least). The stories he tells about growing up with such great privilege were fascinating (seriously - is anyone else troubled about the bathing situation at posh boys schools?????). It also gave exceptional background into his decision to leave royal life - I can't imagine anyone reading this book and being envious of the way any of these people grow up. Charles, William, Harry, they all come across as deeply troubled individuals (and this is coming from someone who had a Prince William poster hanging up until I was in my mid 20s) and cheers to Harry for recognizing that he's fucked, they're all fucked and capitalizing on his truth. Make your money sir. Not quite a five star for me though. This could be a little about royal fatigue. I wasn't as interested in the parts after he meets Meghan because I've heard the story so many times in so many ways recently. That being said there were some fresh stories, some sweet and some salacious. There was also just way too much cringy penis talk for me. Penis talk, yes please. Penis and Mummy combo....hard pass.

Rating 4 out of 5,"The parts I enjoyed most from this book are the ones that I sense most people didn’t read it for: the mundane (and sometimes weird) going-ons of royal and Etonian life, the descriptions of Botswana (reminders of own family’s descriptions of Kenya and Tanzania), stories about shopping incognito, (“Stars, They’re Just Like Us!”), and examples of the Queen’s wicked sense of humor. Moehringer seems to have accurately captured Harry’s voice and charm in this well-written memoir, and unlike folks who feel like he spilled all the tea, I sensed that there was so much more he could have revealed if he wanted to. I bristled at some of the privileged complaints, but found Harry to be generally self-aware. And while descriptions of military service and constant battles with the paparazzi could have been shorter, I can see why he felt compelled to share the detail. All in all, Harry’s story gives us an unprecedented glimpse into the lives of one of history’s most notoriously private families.

Rating 5 out of 5,"I almost didn’t read this book because of all the negative opinions and reviews. I am glad I read it anyway. First, I’m upset that more people don’t want to hear From Harry and have his explanation of things, this is what really compelled me to see what he had to say. (Two sides to every story and the truth really in the middle) and Actions speak louder than words, so even if the palace doesn’t offer a statement, sometime the proof is really in the pudding. Second, I think I was in Harry’s corner even before he wrote how he really felt in regards to the people in his life, and I already knew I held an unpopular view. Probably another reason why I liked the book. However . I was surprised by love that he shows in some of these circumstances where as a I personally would not. Finally, I would hope that after reading his story people can use this as an example as to what your up against when moving away from toxic people in your life especially family members that only “love you” when you jump through their hoops. Trauma is passed down from generation to generation in multiple seen and unseen ways, the Windsors exemplify this in spades. I believe with help Harry has seen this pattern and wants something different for his own family.In conclusion, If you feel the press and public opinion represent Harry better than himself , this book might not be for you. even with that view I hope others will read it anyway. It’s heartbreaking to see families treat each other the way they do but I hope something can be learned from his story.

Rating 4 out of 5,"If you have any interest in this book at all, then I recommend the Audible version which is narrated by Harry. It's just over 15 hours and for someone who is not a professional narrator, he makes a decent job of it. I have no real allegiance to any member of the Royal family, but found this an interesting listen. Of course its just from Harry's perspective which may or may not be accurate - who is to say, but the background detail on his relationship with his family was fascinating, as was his life in the army. By the way, that published quote about the body count was taken out of context, it certainly wasn't a boast.

Rating 4 out of 5,"there's a lot to unpack within these pages of honesty and depth from prince harry. divided into three parts (childhood, military service, and love story with meghan), he offers a glimpse of what is actually going on behind the curtain within the british royal family and how hard it's been growing up under the watchful eye of british media. there's a lot of dark in here but some light too. i wish he detailed less of his time in the military (that was boring) and more on personal reflections of being a member of the royal family and the monarchy in general. though, perhaps that would go too far because despite ongoing feuds, you can tell he loves his family and wants reconciliation. 4 stars bc although he's self-aware, his memoir lacked some nuisances.Show more",4,theres a lot to unpack within these pages of honesty and depth from prince harry divided into three parts childhood military service and love story with meghan he offers a glimpse of what is actually going on behind the curtain within the british royal family and how hard its been growing up under the watchful eye of british media theres a lot of dark in here but some light too i wish he detailed less of his time in the military that was boring and more on personal reflections of being a member of the royal family and the monarchy in general though perhaps that would go too far because despite ongoing feuds you can tell he loves his family and wants reconciliation 4 stars bc although hes selfaware his memoir lacked some nuisancesShow more

Rating 3 out of 5,"I couldn't not read this... And honestly, I still dont know how I really feel about it?All for Harry telling his own story, getting his word out there and all that. The book is filled with trauma that goes back generations in a very old fashioned system that countries have been founded on. So the contents of the actual story are hard to comment on, as its his own life. There are ALOT of times reading this you go, why would you tell us this? what was the point? why do I need to know this? events that do not connect and random passages thrown in. Imagine you are telling your friend a story, and you remember random things as you go, ""oh and this!"" ""oh and this one time!"" there is no system to the events, other than chronologically, there's no logic connection for certain things to be included. Therefore the actual writing feels SUPER messy and all over the place. It is easy to follow the language, as its VERY simple and ""dialogy"", but it just doesn't suit the message the book is telling. The weird and cluttered writing makes the events and stories difficult to read in a serious manner, it becomes more of a comedic story, which this absolutely isn't!I´m a sucker for gossip, and if that's what you want from the royal family (lets face it, that's why most of us are here in the first place) it is definitely and entertaining read and fulfilling. Harry does a good job at sharing his life and events up to today. But the ghost writer does a horrible job at conveying that story. 5 stars to harry but 1 to the actual writer lol!I´m glad I read it though, there's a lot of stories out there, that I'm sure brought a lot of traffic to the book, and finally I can feel relevant loland lastly lets just not talk shit about our family? that goes both ways, nothing ever good comes out of that lol. I love to read about Harrys reflection and struggles, but Kate and Williams marital fights and gossip just doesn't feel relevant to this story? You definitely see Charles in a better light as a father in this book though, compared to all the stories in the news. Anyways!

Rating 5 out of 5,"Harry has the courage to portray his life and his family with brutal honesty, not as portrayed through the prism of the royal family or the press. He is honest about everything, including his mental health issues, his panic attacks and anxiety. His aim in this biography is to correct the lies and smears he says were told about him and Meghan. He clearly has a deep love for his family and has been very hurt by what has happened, but was forced to take a stand in order to defend himself and Meghan and give his version of events and words. It seems clear from what he writes that practices at the Palace need to change and the unwholesome nature of its relationship with the British press needs to be transformed.The last words evoke a spiritual dimension sometimes presented elsewhere in the book.

Rating 4 out of 5,"My Rating: 4.5/5Andddd done.I have no regrets about listening to Harry's memoir. I wanted to listen because it was important for me to form my own thoughts and opinions independently of what I have read in the news, etc. I will say that a lot of what I have seen shared from this book was taken out of context.My BIGGEST takeaway is that he is a man that will forever love and miss his mom. It's actually really heartbreaking. There is so much hurt and sadness stemming from her tragic and untimely death.I am not looking to ""choose sides"" or pick favourites. Harry has his side, the Royal Family will have theirs, and the truth will remain somewhere in the middle. At the end of the day, choosing to listen to this book was no different than me reading a memoir written by a favourite actor or singer. I take it all with a grain of salt.Read it, or don't, but know that is is a well written memoir with a lot more substance than one might think. The few parts with some internal family drama did make me feel slightly awkward as it does feel like he is airing their dirty laundry. I can't help but feel like this will harm his relationships within the Royal Family. Alas, that is not for me to worry about.

Absolutely…. and it would just be a continuation of the judgement the world and the media has constantly thrown upon him. It’s time to just let him tell his story, his way, in his words.

Rating 2 out of 5,"Two hours in, I knew probably I shouldn’t finish reading this. Life is too short. And yet somehow I felt that in order to have a properly informed opinion, I should read the whole thing. This is either judicious or a personal failing on my part. Some of this was interesting, and I was certainly left with the sense that Prince Harry has been a victim on more than one occasion. And since justice matters, his suffering isn’t meaningless But—and this is my primary complaint—what is the point of this book?? I never could figure that out, despite Prince Harry starting with an explicit “this is why I wrote this book” intro. However, his ostensible rationale was ’I had a private argument with my father and older brother in which they both expressed a complete lack of understanding why I would want to leave the royal family, so this is my explanation.’ Am I being overly critical to conclude that this is either a delusionally ineffective method of improving communication with one’s partially estranged kin or a somewhat disingenuous reason for writing a tell-all memoir? My secondary complaint, which is highly related to my first, is that for someone who spends a lot of time talking about going to therapy, it seems that Prince Harry would have done well to disclose and explore much of this in the therapy room… and then leave it there. The Christiana who, at two hours into the book, thought “I do not have space for more of this energy in my life, it is not my job to listen to this, and I cannot even reply to him in a way that would lead to therapeutic growth, so what is the point of me continuing to listen to this?”… she was right. The only reason I didn’t stop was the same reason that I pay attention for a moment when I see a headline or news clip about the royal family… idle curiously. Again, this is not to my commendation.So I learned quite a bit more about Prince Harry, neither to my benefit or his. I don’t know that I’ve ever read a celebrity memoir (admittedly, I’ve read very few, it’s not a great interest of mine) where I’ve respected them this much less after reading it than I did before. Again, Harry has endured a lot, most of it totally outside his will or control. He has certainly been a wronged party, and could place that somewhat into the context of bigger system issues. But what shines through this book most strongly is his deep insecurity. His desire to be understood, approved of, and loved is completely understandable but makes for painful reading. I learned much about him but I almost got a sense of an unreliable narrator when it came to parts of his story, particularly about other people. There was no sense of it being either deliberate or malicious, just… unaware, or somehow limited by the strength of his own self-championing. It was just mostly sad. If you’ve made it this far and still want to read the book yourself despite my previous complaints, my other issues with it will certainly not dissuade you. Have at it.

Rating 5 out of 5,"Ok, buckle up, folks, this is going to be a long review. The short version: This book is sad. Prince Harry’s memoir does what he’s been desperate to do his entire life - tell his story truthfully. Despite the opulence and privilege, there is a lifetime of hurt. Unlike other people’s life stories, Harry’s doesn’t start at birth but what he can remember - it starts at the age of 12 and being told his mother is dead. Due to that trauma, all his memories from before, from with his mother, are gone. Just blocked by his mind that won’t let him live that grief. I’m in tears just thinking about it. And this young boy, not much older than my daughter, is told his mother is dead, given a pat on his knee, he’s left on his own to deal with it, and no one ever speaks of it again. He engages in magical thinking for *years and years* thinking his mother is alive but just in hiding and he is waiting for her to show up and save him. Truly devastating. Throughout the book he is the lost son looking for family, for comfort, for himself. It really breaks your heart. To all those out there saying mean things, I really wish you would give them a chance. The vitriol is unnecessary. Their lives don’t affect your own, just move on. But your vitriol DOES affect their life - the mental health toll, the loss of security, it is real. Really a great memoir and I’m so so glad I did it on audio so Harry read it to me himself. We’re only in January but pretty sure this is my top read for the year and everything else is just vying for second place at this point. Book 12/150 for 2023And now for the look at different parts. 1) The trauma is real. The magical thinking, the inability to cry about his mother for literally two decades after the funeral. Woof, it was hard to hear. He’d tell a story and he’d flashback to the funeral and you’d hear a story going along and then “why is there a union jack on the coffin?” and back to the story. It was jarring and makes your heart stop when you realize what just happened. His life is so much informed by the fact his mother died when he was 12 and she was killed, in his mind (and mine!), at the hands of the paparazzi and by the royal family putting her on the outs. It is absolutely crystal clear why he was terrified seeing history repeat itself with the tabloids harassing his wife to becoming suicidal and his family just standing by and shrugging. I do not blame him for a second for getting out. 2)Lack of comfort. Throughout the book, I wanted to hug Harry. You hear how sad and lost he is, especially as a young boy tragically orphaned. And no one ever hugs him. His dad pats him on the knee when he gives Harry the news. Charles only pats him on the shoulder after Harry comes back from active combat, and Harry describes that as a flamboyant show of emotion. And he says, to my complete shock, that he never has hugged his grandmother. NEVER. This boy who so clearly needed a hug, was touch deprived by his entire family. I’m so glad he got an exuberant American wife, we will hug the crap out of you. Meghan, give him a hug or two or twenty from me, please. 3) So much we thought was true was not. I took a ton of the royal news with a massive grain of salt, so I didn’t believe most of the silly stories. But what gave me a ton of comfort over the years thinking of those two orphaned sons of Diana who wouldn’t know their mother that loved them so, was that they had each other. I really believed they were close and that when Kate came in the picture they were the Three Musketeers. Imagine my absolute dismay and heartbreak to learn *none of that was true.* William (“Willy” as he is called by Harry) was aloof and cold and very competitive with Harry. He was really on his own. 4) Speaking of being on your own, not only was he on his own, all his family members were actively using him and working against him. He had no one to trust - things he said to his own brother and father were fed to the newspaper to bolster themselves, or rehabilitate Camilla. Or used to barter and get a bad story about William/Charles/Camilla/Andrew taken out and run some gossip about Harry and Meghan instead. Charles let a story run that Harry went to rehab, to make himself look better. What cutthroat, distrustful, horrible conditions to live in. Imagine a world where your family feeds your wife to the vultures in order to protect *A SEX OFFENDER* Camilla is a horrible person, I’ve also thought so, and so is Charles. I will never forgive them for what they did to Diana. But now I am doubly never going to forgive them for what they did to Harry and Meghan. And Kate, who I didn’t actually ever hate before, sadly, has also joined my hate list. The woman who so quickly stole all of Meghan’s style, who should have been a helping ear for her to turn to, was a total shit to Meghan. All the royals will do anything to keep the positive media limelight on themselves and they were absolutely threatened by how great Meghan was at being a kind, normal person. I say abolish the monarchy, for many reasons, but also so these whackadoos get a chance to be unstunted, less horrible humans. 5) I am not a military fan, and I won’t get into my strong feelings about the military industrial complex, imperialism, and unwarranted wars against Muslims, but I will say, for a spare who felt absolutely listless and purposeless, it was really interesting to see how much the army gave him as far as structure and purpose and how it was just what he needed. 6) He loves his wife so much. He called her “heart attack beautiful” and I just turned to mush. He loves her so so much and I wish them nothing but happiness and peace. 7) There is a long section about his “todger” that is absolutely unnecessary and WOULD NOT END. I don’t know why it was in there and it was the one thing in the book I did not like. 8) It’s clear Harry has gone to therapy and done the work to heal and grow. It’s more than most people do and I really do wish him well. 9)For those who are all “oh my god, you want a quiet life, why do you keep doing things like write a book, shut up” I say, he was not allowed to have any vocation, the Crown paid for his life, and then it cut him off and he at 38 was on his own. But with no skills. And also with a HUGE HUGE need for EXPENSIVE security due to what he was born into. The security threat is real. The tabloids and his family whipping up stories that put his wife and his children further in harm’s way is real. I do not begrudge him for a second anything he has done to get the income he needs to pay for security. (Also I will continue to be surprised at Tyler Perry’s hero turn in their story, but I am glad they had him when they needed that the most.” Ok, I truly could go on FOREVER. I loved this book. I’m glad I read it. I’m glad I listened to it. I wish them well. Abolish the monarchy (which is not something Harry advocates, he’s still a royal after all). Put Rupert Murdoch in jail. Let’s all hug more. If you’re still reading this review, omg, thank you. www.instagram.com/encyclopedia_britanikaShow more",5,Ok buckle up folks this is going to be a long review The short version This book is sad Prince Harrys memoir does what hes been desperate to do his entire life  tell his story truthfully Despite the opulence and privilege there is a lifetime of hurt Unlike other peoples life stories Harrys doesnt start at birth but what he can remember  it starts at the age of 12 and being told his mother is dead Due to that trauma all his memories from before from with his mother are gone Just blocked by his mind that wont let him live that grief Im in tears just thinking about it And this young boy not much older than my daughter is told his mother is dead given a pat on his knee hes left on his own to deal with it and no one ever speaks of it again He engages in magical thinking for years and years thinking his mother is alive but just in hiding and he is waiting for her to show up and save him Truly devastating Throughout the book he is the lost son looking for family for comfort for himself It really breaks your heart To all those out there saying mean things I really wish you would give them a chance The vitriol is unnecessary Their lives dont affect your own just move on But your vitriol DOES affect their life  the mental health toll the loss of security it is real Really a great memoir and Im so so glad I did it on audio so Harry read it to me himself Were only in January but pretty sure this is my top read for the year and everything else is just vying for second place at this point Book 12150 for 2023And now for the look at different parts 1 The trauma is real The magical thinking the inability to cry about his mother for literally two decades after the funeral Woof it was hard to hear Hed tell a story and hed flashback to the funeral and youd hear a story going along and then why is there a union jack on the coffin and back to the story It was jarring and makes your heart stop when you realize what just happened His life is so much informed by the fact his mother died when he was 12 and she was killed in his mind and mine at the hands of the paparazzi and by the royal family putting her on the outs It is absolutely crystal clear why he was terrified seeing history repeat itself with the tabloids harassing his wife to becoming suicidal and his family just standing by and shrugging I do not blame him for a second for getting out 2Lack of comfort Throughout the book I wanted to hug Harry You hear how sad and lost he is especially as a young boy tragically orphaned And no one ever hugs him His dad pats him on the knee when he gives Harry the news Charles only pats him on the shoulder after Harry comes back from active combat and Harry describes that as a flamboyant show of emotion And he says to my complete shock that he never has hugged his grandmother NEVER This boy who so clearly needed a hug was touch deprived by his entire family Im so glad he got an exuberant American wife we will hug the crap out of you Meghan give him a hug or two or twenty from me please 3 So much we thought was true was not I took a ton of the royal news with a massive grain of salt so I didnt believe most of the silly stories But what gave me a ton of comfort over the years thinking of those two orphaned sons of Diana who wouldnt know their mother that loved them so was that they had each other I really believed they were close and that when Kate came in the picture they were the Three Musketeers Imagine my absolute dismay and heartbreak to learn none of that was true William Willy as he is called by Harry was aloof and cold and very competitive with Harry He was really on his own 4 Speaking of being on your own not only was he on his own all his family members were actively using him and working against him He had no one to trust  things he said to his own brother and father were fed to the newspaper to bolster themselves or rehabilitate Camilla Or used to barter and get a bad story about WilliamCharlesCamillaAndrew taken out and run some gossip about Harry and Meghan instead Charles let a story run that Harry went to rehab to make himself look better What cutthroat distrustful horrible conditions to live in Imagine a world where your family feeds your wife to the vultures in order to protect A SEX OFFENDER Camilla is a horrible person Ive also thought so and so is Charles I will never forgive them for what they did to Diana But now I am doubly never going to forgive them for what they did to Harry and Meghan And Kate who I didnt actually ever hate before sadly has also joined my hate list The woman who so quickly stole all of Meghans style who should have been a helping ear for her to turn to was a total shit to Meghan All the royals will do anything to keep the positive media limelight on themselves and they were absolutely threatened by how great Meghan was at being a kind normal person I say abolish the monarchy for many reasons but also so these whackadoos get a chance to be unstunted less horrible humans 5 I am not a military fan and I wont get into my strong feelings about the military industrial complex imperialism and unwarranted wars against Muslims but I will say for a spare who felt absolutely listless and purposeless it was really interesting to see how much the army gave him as far as structure and purpose and how it was just what he needed 6 He loves his wife so much He called her heart attack beautiful and I just turned to mush He loves her so so much and I wish them nothing but happiness and peace 7 There is a long section about his todger that is absolutely unnecessary and WOULD NOT END I dont know why it was in there and it was the one thing in the book I did not like 8 Its clear Harry has gone to therapy and done the work to heal and grow Its more than most people do and I really do wish him well 9For those who are all oh my god you want a quiet life why do you keep doing things like write a book shut up I say he was not allowed to have any vocation the Crown paid for his life and then it cut him off and he at 38 was on his own But with no skills And also with a HUGE HUGE need for EXPENSIVE security due to what he was born into The security threat is real The tabloids and his family whipping up stories that put his wife and his children further in harms way is real I do not begrudge him for a second anything he has done to get the income he needs to pay for security Also I will continue to be surprised at Tyler Perrys hero turn in their story but I am glad they had him when they needed that the most Ok I truly could go on FOREVER I loved this book Im glad I read it Im glad I listened to it I wish them well Abolish the monarchy which is not something Harry advocates hes still a royal after all Put Rupert Murdoch in jail Lets all hug more If youre still reading this review omg thank you

Rating 4 out of 5,"Spare may be a controversial book, but I found it insightful, well written and an enjoyable read. Prince Harry details his own version of life events that the press has taken the liberty to inflate, sensationalize or outright fictionalize for the general public. I am ashamed by how often I’ve fallen for the ‘trickle down’ impact of the press whether they’re reporting on the Royal family or any number of other A-list celebs. Yet, underneath the thread of the press narrative is the story of a young man simply trying to find his identity in a world that is constantly trying to define it for him. And along this journey, many of Harry’s life experiences are surprisingly relatable: from challenging family dynamics (we all have them!) to mental health to handling grief to youthful acting out to pining for a genuine connection with another person to finding the love of his life. To those who are disgruntled by the mere idea of this book, I encourage you to see it for what it is: a memoir. That is, a self reflection on the events on one’s life. It’s not meant to provide answers or even a well rounded portrayal of events, but is instead a space to process (thoughtfully) how one has been shaped by their environment, relationships, events, etc.Spare is divided in three sections which are each made up of essays, making it easy to digest. I felt Spare deserved a 5 star review until reading the final section. The last part had a tone that was contradictory to the rest of the memoir: instead of being thoughtful and self reflective, it was emotionally driven, and much of the events full of speculation and unresolved conflict that I feel will work against his hope for reconciliation, particularly with his brother. The content felt too soon to comment on, though I can understand why it was included as those events motivated the entire writing of the memoir. It was just too divulging for my own comfort.Show more",4,Spare may be a controversial book but I found it insightful well written and an enjoyable read Prince Harry details his own version of life events that the press has taken the liberty to inflate sensationalize or outright fictionalize for the general public I am ashamed by how often Ive fallen for the trickle down impact of the press whether theyre reporting on the Royal family or any number of other Alist celebs Yet underneath the thread of the press narrative is the story of a young man simply trying to find his identity in a world that is constantly trying to define it for him And along this journey many of Harrys life experiences are surprisingly relatable from challenging family dynamics we all have them to mental health to handling grief to youthful acting out to pining for a genuine connection with another person to finding the love of his life To those who are disgruntled by the mere idea of this book I encourage you to see it for what it is a memoir That is a self reflection on the events on ones life Its not meant to provide answers or even a well rounded portrayal of events but is instead a space to process thoughtfully how one has been shaped by their environment relationships events etcSpare is divided in three sections which are each made up of essays making it easy to digest I felt Spare deserved a 5 star review until reading the final section The last part had a tone that was contradictory to the rest of the memoir instead of being thoughtful and self reflective it was emotionally driven and much of the events full of speculation and unresolved conflict that I feel will work against his hope for reconciliation particularly with his brother The content felt too soon to comment on though I can understand why it was included as those events motivated the entire writing of the memoir It was just too divulging for my own comfortShow more
Rating 4 out of 5,"whoa, lots of thoughts on this one. I've had an interest in and have been cursory following the Royals since Charles and Diana's wedding, so I was familiar with the set-up for the book. Biggest takeaway: wow, what a messed-up, dysfunctional family. Harry is very self-aware about his shortcomings (not smart, troublemaker in school, drugs, didn't go to college), and open about his time in the military, which helped him mature and find value in himself. He was forced at a young age into unimaginable grief with no support at all from his family. However, he has real blind spots. He claims Megan didn't know who he was or understand his role or celebrity, but really? When she met him, she was already spending a lot of time in London and how can you miss him? And he didn't really help prepare her for what life in his family was like (Kate had a long education ""waity Katey"" was her nickname, but it prepared her). There were times when I would have loved to hear William's version because sometimes he's painted as just horrible when I imagine some of it would be understandable when you hear the other side. No all of it, but some of it.All that said, it was a fascinating look at royal life in palaces/gilded cages. Most of his vitriol is for the press, deservedly. But the last chapters are quite damning toward his father and brother, and while I do 100% believe him and what the family did (and didn't do) to him and Meghan, I honestly can't imagine how this family will reconcile. Too much has been said under the umbrella of honesty. Patti Reagan wrote an editorial 20 years after her book was published regretting what she had said about her father in her ""it's time to hear my story"" book and I wonder if Harry will feel the same.Also, I read it in audio and I highly recommend that. The book is written/ghostwritten beautifully and despite no experience, Harry is a very comfortable and natural audio narrator.Show more",4,whoa lots of thoughts on this one Ive had an interest in and have been cursory following the Royals since Charles and Dianas wedding so I was familiar with the setup for the book Biggest takeaway wow what a messedup dysfunctional family Harry is very selfaware about his shortcomings not smart troublemaker in school drugs didnt go to college and open about his time in the military which helped him mature and find value in himself He was forced at a young age into unimaginable grief with no support at all from his family However he has real blind spots He claims Megan didnt know who he was or understand his role or celebrity but really When she met him she was already spending a lot of time in London and how can you miss him And he didnt really help prepare her for what life in his family was like Kate had a long education waity Katey was her nickname but it prepared her There were times when I would have loved to hear Williams version because sometimes hes painted as just horrible when I imagine some of it would be understandable when you hear the other side No all of it but some of itAll that said it was a fascinating look at royal life in palacesgilded cages Most of his vitriol is for the press deservedly But the last chapters are quite damning toward his father and brother and while I do 100 believe him and what the family did and didnt do to him and Meghan I honestly cant imagine how this family will reconcile Too much has been said under the umbrella of honesty Patti Reagan wrote an editorial 20 years after her book was published regretting what she had said about her father in her its time to hear my story book and I wonder if Harry will feel the sameAlso I read it in audio and I highly recommend that The book is writtenghostwritten beautifully and despite no experience Harry is a very comfortable and natural audio narratorShow more
Rating 4 out of 5,"So many people encourage mental health positivity but because Harry was born into a privileged life that he couldn’t really escape from, people seem to not want to extend empathy or support toward him. Yes, Harry is a royal and has been given more than most people. More money. More status. More opportunities…does that mean he isn’t able to feel the grief of losing his mother at a young age? Do riches cancel out trauma and PTSD he faced while fighting in a war? … Of course not. Anyway, I just wanted to get that out there because while listening to the audio of this book, I was reminded that this man is just a human, trying to live and enjoy life the best he can against whatever life throws in his path. Yes, his hardships are different from those that many of us face, but that’s what makes this story so fascinating. His experience is that of which no one else has had, but we can all relate to the feelings of loss and isolation. It was humanizing. I liked getting insight into Harry’s experiences as he candidly spoke on the various mistakes he made in his youth, his misguided choices, personal issues (sometimes major TMI) and the self loathing and disappointment he felt at times as he grew into who he is now. When you’re raised in the public eye like he has been, people often want to say who they think you are, so it was nice to hear who HE believes himself to be in his own words. This memoir allowed someone who has often been told what to say and do the ability to tell his own story. Even after this came out, the media twisted his words into their own narrative. I can assure you, he doesn’t “brag” about the people he killed while in the army. Instead, he lays out the facts and details how he had to process it all so he could deal with taking another human’s life. Overall, this was good. I learned some stuff I didn’t know, (like he was not allowed to hug his own Grandmother since she was the Queen) I gained new perspective (how lonely he was living in a “gilded cage”) and I recognized Prince Harry as a flawed human trying to do his best in a world who likes to assign and categorize people until nothing is left but a sliver of who the person actually is. Get the audio! Harry reads it himself, which is nice and I loved hearing him describe the first time he saw Meghan Markle. It was sweet. I’m not saying I’m a fan now, or that I’m not. But at least I have a new understanding of who he is and the unique experiences he’s had that aren’t filtered through the lens of a paparazzi camera or a tabloid.

Rating 2 out of 5,"2.5 StarsThe writing ... it was awful. I know this was written by ghostwriters, but you would have thought they would put more effort to have a cohesive writing style. Instead, we have multiple writing styles that are flitted between wrapped up with an immense level of tone-deafness. It read in parts like the tabloids with the descriptive language utilised which is extremely ironic. Even the content had a poor layout. We spend so much time with Prince Harry in the military, and yet the actual interesting parts of his story from when he meets Meghan onwards are covered so quickly. I learnt a lot by hearing Prince Harry's story such as the trauma he has dealt with and is still dealing with, his relationship with his brother, and the next-level hell the media put him and his loved ones through. At the same time, I have come to the conclusion that he still needs serious therapy just based on how and when he refers to his mother and how he still refers to her as ""mummy"". I don't know how many grown men call their mother ""mummy"" but I doubt it's many. What upsets me most is this could have been a spectacular book highlighting the dysfunction of the monarchy. Instead, it was very much Prince Harry's individual story with little insight into the deeper systemic issues at play. That disappoints me. I also query the sort of culture rich boys are absorbed in because how can you honestly not know that wearing a Nazi costume is wrong? Are you not learnt history properly at school? Why were you not motivated to educate yourself further?The audiobook was hard to get through because I couldn't really stand Prince Harry's voice or his use of nicknames for everyone.

Rating 4 out of 5,"Review to come! This is a complicated one to review, but it was an easy one to listen to._________________________________________4⭐️/5I think it's worth saying that this review is of the memoir, and not the person/institution/mess that is the royal family.As far as memoirs go, this one really did have a lot of what I look for: deeply personal revelations, humor, entertaining stories, reflections, rawness, empathy, and, of course, some tea (it is a celebrity memoir after all).The biggest criticism I've seen around this memoir is, ""why release this book so soon after the documentary? Haven't we heard it all before?"" And, quite honestly, the answer is no. Meghan isn't even mentioned until maybe 70% of the way through, and up until that point, Harry draws from his earliest memories of childhood through his army days (quite a bit of the book is dedicated to this period of his life), up to the present. It is primarily a reflection on his life post-August 31st, 1997, and how he has failed to grapple with his mother's death.The reason it was 4⭐️ and not 5 is because it dragged a bit in the middle. Though I still appreciated his story, his passion for wildlife conservation, mental health advocacy, and his mother country, it lacked that extra resonance I look for in a memoir, or perhaps it was the lack of accountability.Overall, this memoir is not for everyone! I think those that want to hate-read it are doing so, those that want to avoid it are doing just that, which will always be the case for such a high-profile person.Show more",4,Review to come This is a complicated one to review but it was an easy one to listen to_________________________________________45I think its worth saying that this review is of the memoir and not the personinstitutionmess that is the royal familyAs far as memoirs go this one really did have a lot of what I look for deeply personal revelations humor entertaining stories reflections rawness empathy and of course some tea it is a celebrity memoir after allThe biggest criticism Ive seen around this memoir is why release this book so soon after the documentary Havent we heard it all before And quite honestly the answer is no Meghan isnt even mentioned until maybe 70 of the way through and up until that point Harry draws from his earliest memories of childhood through his army days quite a bit of the book is dedicated to this period of his life up to the present It is primarily a reflection on his life postAugust 31st 1997 and how he has failed to grapple with his mothers deathThe reason it was 4 and not 5 is because it dragged a bit in the middle Though I still appreciated his story his passion for wildlife conservation mental health advocacy and his mother country it lacked that extra resonance I look for in a memoir or perhaps it was the lack of accountabilityOverall this memoir is not for everyone I think those that want to hateread it are doing so those that want to avoid it are doing just that which will always be the case for such a highprofile personShow more
Rating 4 out of 5,"I hesitate to write a review because I know Harry and Meghan are amongst the many topics about which people get heated about nowadays. But I’m here to talk about a book, not to debate. I was surprised by how well-written the book is. After a bit of research, I discovered it was ghost-written by J. Moehringer, who wrote The Tender Bar as well as some other well-known memoirs. Harry and Meghan have been out there telling their story so much of the content was already known to me. But the book does give a real flavor of what Harry’s life as a royal has been like. It’s not a life he chose and I do believe is not a life he would have chosen given a choice. He talks about his struggles with anxiety and panic attacks, his complicated relationships with his family (especially “Willy”), the impact of his lifelong status as “the spare,” and the constant barrage of the press and the endless misinformation and how it’s impacted his life and feelings of self-worth. People want to know why he and Meghan feel the need to reach out to the media they supposedly hate. I believe Harry when he says he wants a chance to set the record straight and tell his side of the story. He’s not an entertainer who chose to be the subject of media attention; it’ll be there no matter what because of who he is. Harry’s rift from his family and country is unfortunate and possibly not fixable. I’ve watched The Crown.. The crown is supposed to come before everything including self and family. The rest of the family apparently still buys into that. Harry doesn’t. I’ve no doubt that the family would have a different perspective on the issues raised in this book. Especially “Willy,” who is portrayed as a real prick (who Harry loves), but we’ll never hear that side because it just isn’t done when you’re a royal. I found this memoir very interesting. It gave real insight into a family so much in the public eye and what it’s like to live your whole life surrounded by paps.

Rating 4 out of 5,"What a journey devouring this book on audio the last four days (definitely the way to go, hearing it in his own voice). First off, I have always felt a special personal connection to William and Harry. My own mother was tragically killed, somewhat publicly, when I was a child in 1992; and I vividly remember a few years later when Diana died in 1997 watching these boys and for the first time in my life, seeing other children who shared my own experience. I know what it is to have the ripple affects permanently affect who you become as a person, how you see the world, and how it complicates your remaining family relationships. This connection has stuck with me as I became more deeply interested over the last year in the very complicated, problematic, fascinating story of the British royal family. This isn’t a perfect book and Harry is not a perfect man, but I felt his authentic desire to share his own truth as someone whose story has so often been told for him, without his permission. I was deeply struck by the trauma and baggage he has carried (and still carries) from his mother’s death, the responsibility of the paparazzi, and their continued hounding of him since. The vitriol and racism that Meghan and he have faced and continue to face is so deeply wrong and telling about our global society. The public shaming at “airing his dirty laundry” feels obtuse and a coded way to resist calling out harm and pursue healing in the face of torrents of abuse. The first section was particularly compelling, as were the last chapter and epilogue. There were many moments throughout that I jotted down in surprise or interest; the war sections got long but it clearly shaped who he is; the Meghan sections were repetitive from the documentary but overall, I won’t forget this reading experience. I wish them the best and wish others might pause and allow for some empathy and more both/and thinking when it comes to these two and the entire situation.Show more",4,What a journey devouring this book on audio the last four days definitely the way to go hearing it in his own voice First off I have always felt a special personal connection to William and Harry My own mother was tragically killed somewhat publicly when I was a child in 1992 and I vividly remember a few years later when Diana died in 1997 watching these boys and for the first time in my life seeing other children who shared my own experience I know what it is to have the ripple affects permanently affect who you become as a person how you see the world and how it complicates your remaining family relationships This connection has stuck with me as I became more deeply interested over the last year in the very complicated problematic fascinating story of the British royal family This isnt a perfect book and Harry is not a perfect man but I felt his authentic desire to share his own truth as someone whose story has so often been told for him without his permission I was deeply struck by the trauma and baggage he has carried and still carries from his mothers death the responsibility of the paparazzi and their continued hounding of him since The vitriol and racism that Meghan and he have faced and continue to face is so deeply wrong and telling about our global society The public shaming at airing his dirty laundry feels obtuse and a coded way to resist calling out harm and pursue healing in the face of torrents of abuse The first section was particularly compelling as were the last chapter and epilogue There were many moments throughout that I jotted down in surprise or interest the war sections got long but it clearly shaped who he is the Meghan sections were repetitive from the documentary but overall I wont forget this reading experience I wish them the best and wish others might pause and allow for some empathy and more bothand thinking when it comes to these two and the entire situationShow more
Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 rounded downEDIT: ( I realized I rated Mean Baby by Selma Blair 4 stars and I did not think this book was of the same caliber. Alas, I adjusted ) I had a really hard time deciding on a rating for this. Prince Harry is definitely a very capable writer and I enjoyed the structure of the memoir as kind of linear vignettes. And, there’s no denying he has a hell of a lot of stories and unique perspectives to share. I found the book to be on the longer and slightly drawn out side, but still incredibly compelling. I guess I am just struggling with the necessity of this book. While I think he absolutely deserves to publicly share his honest and unfiltered personal views and experiences, I feel that he’s already partially done this through several “tell-all” interviews and his recent Netflix docuseries. While there was a decent amount of new information in this memoir, I found myself glazing over details and scenarios that I have already listened to from his very own perspective several times over now. I almost wish this came out before the rest of the TV appearances and specials. Then, it would have truly been groundbreaking.

Rating 4 out of 5,"Overall this book is a little bit too much of everything, and like we Mexican say, le puso mucho crema a sus tacos (meaning he added way too much crema to his tacos). There were parts where I thought, was this really necessary? Like a frostbite incident…Saying that there were things that clicked with me in a way that made me feel seen and that’s the reason I continued with the book and the fact that Harry has a voice perfect for narrating.Number one is grief, see I lost both of my parents very young and in a very sudden and tragic way; so I understand where he is coming from speaking about grief and not moving on in fear of loosing the memory of the one we lost.Number two is anxiety and depression, I am in the middle of a burnout that not only caused me anxiety but also severe hair loss panic attacks, and even eczema; listening to him speak about this so openly gave me hope, I am still hiding with some what’s happened to me because I felt embarrassed, but this is because society tells us that mental health is an issue we shouldn’t voice and I am happy Harry is speaking about this.Show more",4,Overall this book is a little bit too much of everything and like we Mexican say le puso mucho crema a sus tacos meaning he added way too much crema to his tacos There were parts where I thought was this really necessary Like a frostbite incidentSaying that there were things that clicked with me in a way that made me feel seen and thats the reason I continued with the book and the fact that Harry has a voice perfect for narratingNumber one is grief see I lost both of my parents very young and in a very sudden and tragic way so I understand where he is coming from speaking about grief and not moving on in fear of loosing the memory of the one we lostNumber two is anxiety and depression I am in the middle of a burnout that not only caused me anxiety but also severe hair loss panic attacks and even eczema listening to him speak about this so openly gave me hope I am still hiding with some whats happened to me because I felt embarrassed but this is because society tells us that mental health is an issue we shouldnt voice and I am happy Harry is speaking about thisShow more
Rating 2 out of 5,"Prince Harry’s memoir, Spare, has taken the world by storm and we finally gave into the hype surrounding it. Divided into 3 parts, Spare offers insight into Harry’s tumultuous life and dishes out some royal tea for the world to see. Although we cannot comment on the veracity of the claims made, as readers we found Spare undulant at best. It is obvious that Harry has poured his heart into this book and the rawness of his emotions, especially those surrounding the loss of his mother, was heart-rending; unfortunately, it could not salvage the book.Parts 1 and 2, centred around his childhood and adolescence and military service, respectively, found their highs in the descriptions of his relationship with his family and friends, the aftermath of Princess Diana’s untimely demise, Harry’s battle with substance abuse and mental health issues, and his emotional maturation during his time in the army (albeit we only got a small glimpse of it). And Part 3, which focused on his relationship with Meghan and the adversities they faced at the hands of the press, essentially comprised the material we’ve seen discussed extensively in their interview with Oprah and their Netflix special. However, for the remainder of these parts, he came off as entitled, ignorant, and petulant. We especially disliked how he used seemingly normal things like sibling rivalry to vilify Prince William and even made several unnecessary and petty comments (his baldness, really?!). It is evident that Harry harbours a lot of unresolved trauma, some stemming from his relationship with his brother, but to address it in this manner just seemed insensitive. Furthermore, the constant fluctuation in writing style, which varied from short, abrupt phrases to long, poetic descriptions, made it easy to pinpoint the parts that were written by the Prince and the ghostwriter, respectively and detracted from the reading experience. Some areas were unnecessarily long and superfluous and they eventually felt frustrating and even led to several unintended naps.Nevertheless, Spare has certainly created an impact. Harry's unabashed acknowledgement of his emotional state, mental health, and even his frostbitten genitalia (although we could’ve done with significantly less detail!) served to remind us that the royal family were only human. We especially appreciated how he called out the press and their unethical practices, and we truly empathise with the family. However, we have heard these stories in 3 different formats in the recent past and it's starting to get a little monotonous. It may be time for them to put this behind them and move forward in their lives.

Rating 4 out of 5,"This was gut wrenching and heartbreaking. Harry’s story - while one side of the story - is told poignantly and with immense reflection. His observations of the painful and unfair abuse throughout his whole life was never without the perspective of recognizing the luxury of being born into the monarchy. That said, it will be hard pressed to not walk away without feeing deep empathy and maybe even outrage on his behalf. And we readers are complicit in getting sucked up in the fantasy and/or lies the press spins for us to devour. I have very distinct memories of seeing tabloid covers of many of the moments he recounts and can admit, that while tabloids are not read with any true seriousness, I still bought into the narrative I was fed for much of his young life - Harry as the bad boy, the troublemaker, etc. And while I am among many who understand that tabloids are mostly fabrication, so so so many people read them as gospel. This was a more shocking read than I expected it to be and I highly recommend you listen (audio feels like the best way to digest this) and form your own opinions.Show more",4,This was gut wrenching and heartbreaking Harrys story  while one side of the story  is told poignantly and with immense reflection His observations of the painful and unfair abuse throughout his whole life was never without the perspective of recognizing the luxury of being born into the monarchy That said it will be hard pressed to not walk away without feeing deep empathy and maybe even outrage on his behalf And we readers are complicit in getting sucked up in the fantasy andor lies the press spins for us to devour I have very distinct memories of seeing tabloid covers of many of the moments he recounts and can admit that while tabloids are not read with any true seriousness I still bought into the narrative I was fed for much of his young life  Harry as the bad boy the troublemaker etc And while I am among many who understand that tabloids are mostly fabrication so so so many people read them as gospel This was a more shocking read than I expected it to be and I highly recommend you listen audio feels like the best way to digest this and form your own opinionsShow more

Rating 4 out of 5,"I am 100% Team Harry and Meghan, and I'm not ashamed to say it. I will also never believe another headline about the royal family. I respect what Harry was trying to accomplish with this book, and although there were some strange parts that seemed unnecessary, I understand the intention behind it. I've heard some PR people talk about the strategies they think Harry and Meghan were using in order to establish their independence from the British press, and I can't help but support them for doing what they have to do to put an end to the chaos. (AKA if Harry shares every little detail and seemingly unimportant parts of his life first, then the British press can't ""break"" the story and control the narrative. He's sharing anything that could possibly be used against him.) I think the Royal Family dynamic is fascinating, I love Meghan and Harry's love story, but most of all I love that Harry was able to take control of the narrative of his life - probably for the first time ever.

Rating 4 out of 5,"Things I cannot get over from reading this book:- how the queen isn’t allowed (by protocol???) to hug her children/grandchildren - how Harry secretly believed his mom was just in hiding for years, and not dead, and how excruciatingly sad it is that he didn’t have more support to process that loss - how Kate can be unflappable in front of such big crowds and royal pressures but is emotionally devastated by somebody casually suggesting she has “baby brain”- how many freaking times Harry went to Botswana, the jealousy almost consumed me- how surprisingly good Charles came off (and the opposite for William)- how Harry’s “todger” is a minor supporting character in the book, and hey, good for him 😂Listen, Harry clearly grew up in a cage. It was gilded, yes, and posh, but a cage nonetheless, and the royal family kind of feels like a fancy cult that maybe shouldn’t exist. A fun, interesting, dishy, compelling read. I saw a tiktok from a therapist that said the book feels like the clients who come from toxic systems and are the only ones in it to go to therapy and then are like “guys, this is not ok and this is why,” and that feels right.

Rating 5 out of 5,"It’s taken me days to decide what I think about Spare. My first response was empathy. I didn’t lose my mother, but my father disappeared from my life when I was young. The loss of a parent at any age is hard, but it’s especially hard when you’re a child. Harry makes it clear that losing his mother in such a violent and tragic way has influenced everything in his life from that point. My second response to the book was that it felt like Harry was finally talking about what he’d held inside for years. It was like once he started telling his story he couldn’t stop. Harry seems to feel emotions in a big way that isn’t consistent with his family’s “stiff upper lip, we don’t talk about it” culture. Throughout the book he talks about wanting to talk to his family and reconcile. He doesn’t do it from the viewpoint of “I’m right and they’re wrong and they need to apologize.” He says he’ll acknowledge whatever part he’s played in the rift that’s dividing them. But he wants it to be done behind closed doors without leaking stories to the press. The leaking of stories by his own family seems to be a huge part of why he and Meghan stepped down and left. There’s been a ton of criticism of him for sharing how he lost his virginity and the story of his frostbitten “todger.” The virginity story is brief and he doesn’t tell much except his age and implies that it wasn’t with anyone he had a meaningful relationship with. It’s just a milestone that’s part of his life story. It fit in and he didn’t sensationalize it. The frostbitten penis story was humorous and gave a little comedy to an overall sad story. It’s obvious he loves his father and brother and wants to be part of the family again if the relationships can be less toxic. He writes with both sadness and affection about those two relationships. As a long-time royal watcher I’d love to see him reconcile with his family. I was so excited when he married Meghan and they were working royals. They brought a modern approach to the royals and could have been a huge asset in making the monarchy more relevant. But when the nasty, racist tabloid stories about Meghan came out it was business as usual. “Ignore the stories. We’ve all had to live through it.” The difference to me, in this situation compared to how the press treats other royals, is that much of it was racially based and some of it was hate-filled and threatening and the family didn’t address it either publicly or privately. No wonder they wanted to get away. Harry tells his story in an open way that was appealing to me. He’s lived his whole life in the public eye and it makes sense he’d want to tell his story in a very public way. It’s the only way he knows how to live. Obviously I liked the book, I gave it five stars. If you’re not a royal watcher it probably won’t be as interesting as it was to me. But if you are, you’ll probably have strong feelings about it one way or the other.Show more",5,Its taken me days to decide what I think about Spare My first response was empathy I didnt lose my mother but my father disappeared from my life when I was young The loss of a parent at any age is hard but its especially hard when youre a child Harry makes it clear that losing his mother in such a violent and tragic way has influenced everything in his life from that point My second response to the book was that it felt like Harry was finally talking about what hed held inside for years It was like once he started telling his story he couldnt stop Harry seems to feel emotions in a big way that isnt consistent with his familys stiff upper lip we dont talk about it culture Throughout the book he talks about wanting to talk to his family and reconcile He doesnt do it from the viewpoint of Im right and theyre wrong and they need to apologize He says hell acknowledge whatever part hes played in the rift thats dividing them But he wants it to be done behind closed doors without leaking stories to the press The leaking of stories by his own family seems to be a huge part of why he and Meghan stepped down and left Theres been a ton of criticism of him for sharing how he lost his virginity and the story of his frostbitten todger The virginity story is brief and he doesnt tell much except his age and implies that it wasnt with anyone he had a meaningful relationship with Its just a milestone thats part of his life story It fit in and he didnt sensationalize it The frostbitten penis story was humorous and gave a little comedy to an overall sad story Its obvious he loves his father and brother and wants to be part of the family again if the relationships can be less toxic He writes with both sadness and affection about those two relationships As a longtime royal watcher Id love to see him reconcile with his family I was so excited when he married Meghan and they were working royals They brought a modern approach to the royals and could have been a huge asset in making the monarchy more relevant But when the nasty racist tabloid stories about Meghan came out it was business as usual Ignore the stories Weve all had to live through it The difference to me in this situation compared to how the press treats other royals is that much of it was racially based and some of it was hatefilled and threatening and the family didnt address it either publicly or privately No wonder they wanted to get away Harry tells his story in an open way that was appealing to me Hes lived his whole life in the public eye and it makes sense hed want to tell his story in a very public way Its the only way he knows how to live Obviously I liked the book I gave it five stars If youre not a royal watcher it probably wont be as interesting as it was to me But if you are youll probably have strong feelings about it one way or the otherShow more

The book is a deep-dive into Harry’s adolescence, army years, starting and building of his own family with Meghan, and of course – there’s plenty of behind the scenes of the royal family.The first part of the book felt somehow dragged out, but as Harry turns onto army years and meeting Meghan, the book picks up its pace. I especially enjoyed the insights of the royal life, but felt deeply for Harry and Meghan as there seems to be so much passive aggressiveness and manipulation within this family.

Rating 4 out of 5,"What a read. I’m a bit speechless to say the least. I don’t understand why he felt the need to publish a book. Given there major wish for privacy. Was it all about money? Was it to destroy our Monarchy? Very sad that he felt the need to share intimate private family conversations with the world. Not happy if anyone else shares, but ok for him to do so. He certainly has a huge chip on his shoulders. There have been ‘spares’ before him and since him. But he seems to crave publicity yet condemns it on the other hand. I agree how the media have treated them is disgusting and shouldn’t happen to anyone. But I blame our government for allowing this to happen. Especially in this day and age when mental health awareness is everywhere. I don’t read papers. When growing up you soon realise the majority of what they publish is full of lies. They know this but continue to read it and get upset. They need to stop and consider that not maybe people read it. And even fewer would believe it. I’d seen a few headlines like the one where Meg made Kate cry. I get the need to get the truth out there. But what do they get from it? More press coverage? More press following them about no doubt He says they crave ‘privacy’ what about the people he mentions in the book? Many people talked about and conversations quoted. Incidents mentioned. But did he ask these people for permission to mention them? Probably not so seems invasion of privacy only works one way with Harry!!! Did he really need to mention the magic chocolate mushrooms in Courtney Coxs fridge? Did he ask her permission to mention such an invasion of privacy? Did she even know they were there? Don’t really get the constant need to talk about his penis. Is he that desperate for attention?!?I have every sympathy when it comes to the death of his mother. Diana was a one and only people’s Princess. What happened to her once again should never have been allowed to happen. But she did court the media to suit herself too. I felt he brought up his mother rather a lot. Is that to sell more books? I hope notVery sad if what’s written in this book is true about what goes on behind palace walls. Guess it shows there just like any other family in our country. One thing that really got me. Him having to board a public flight after the death of his Grandmother. That’s wrong. All the wealth and means of our royal family and they allowed this to happen. Shame on you all. I hope the family of 4 are happy now. They seem to be happy and settled. I hope they are given the privacy and freedom they crave. But I have a funny feeling they will be never far away. Was nice to read about Harry’s life growing up.

Rating 3 out of 5,"Be serious, if it wasn't for Meghan Markle I probably never would have picked up this book. It's interesting to read and hear Harry's version of all the soap opera drama constantly splashed across global headlines. I listened to the audio, which is narrated by Harry. Harry and Meghan are the IRL 'we're not like everyone else, we're different'. I do understand and connect with Harry on constantly learning and relearning how to deal with emotions, mental health, and finding purpose. Harry comes from a very privileged place. He has every resource he could ever want at his fingertips. Yet he still struggles. And I get that. My privileged aren't as grand as his. But I do come from a place of some privilege. And I've always struggled with my mental health and self worth. There's always this constant guilt bouncing around in my head because there are so many worse off and more deserving people. My problems are so insignificant in the bigger picture. And honestly, that's what I feel like Harry is trying to convey with Spare. Maybe you call it whining and complaining or seeking attention.

Rating 4 out of 5,"I’m not much into celebrity culture and am ambivalent on the British royal family, though I understand that so many people base their identity and belief systems on the way famous people behave and present themselves. That said, I enjoy reading about what it’s like being in another person’s shoes and so love a good memoir.What’s fascinating to me when it comes to this particular book, which is apparently setting all kinds of records, is how many people project themselves into the life of Prince Harry and have all kinds of advice on how he should and shouldn’t behave.And I think that is exactly the point of this memoir.Up to this point, he’s not been the architect of his own life and his own story. Being a royal might be an extraordinarily ornate prison, but it’s a prison, nonetheless. And why shouldn’t he tell his story? I know I would.That said, the title of the book comes from a common British expression of the ideal plan for a monarch, to have an “heir and a spare.” In this personal memoir, Prince Harry documents in vivid detail:•	What it’s like to be raised a royal and go to school with a massive media lens on your every action. It's like being the star of The Truman Show, every day, in every action. Only now the media lens watching you isn't always benevolent, and even under the toxic Murdoch media empire, the only advice you're ever given is ""never complain, never explain."" •	What it’s like to lose your mother at twelve and have to help console a nation; and then as an adult, drive though the Paris tunnel where your mother was killed while being chased by the paparazzi.•	What it’s like to be in the Royal Army and specifically as an army air traffic controller in Afghanistan. “For the first time in my life I was just a name, a random name, and a random number. No title. And no bodyguard. Is this what other people feel like every day? I savored the normality, wallowed in it, and also considered how far I’d journeyed to find it. Central Afghanistan, the dead of winter, the middle of the night, the midst of war, while speaking to a man fifteen thousand feet above my head– how abnormal is your life if that’s the first place you ever feel normal?”•	What’s it’s like to have your every relationship detail being the subject of judgmental scrutiny by a soulless media machine. Most relationships ended because of that scrutiny. One of his prior girlfriends and he split up after they discovered a tracking device placed on the underside her car by paparazzi. “Chels said again that she wasn’t sure if she was up for this. A lifetime of being stalked? What could I say? I’d miss her, so much. But I completely understood her desire for freedom. If I had a choice, I wouldn’t want this life, either.”•	What it’s like to journey to both the north and south poles of the globe, what it’s like to chase rhinoceros poachers in central Africa, and what it’s like to be in the heat of action in the war in Afghanistan. Among his accomplishments, Prince Harry started the Invictus Games, an annual event to honor and celebrate wounded veterans by drawing attention to their resilience and resolve.•	What it's like to consider that by law, the first six in line to the throne legally have to ask permission from the sovereign to marry (Royal Marriages Act of 1772) first. He even had to ask permission to keep his beard at his wedding.It's clear that the biggest source of animosity by Harry is the unscrupulous paparazzi - the same group responsible for the death of his mother. At one point, Harry talks about two particularly aggressive members of the paparazzi (""paps"") he refers to as Tweedle Dumb and Tweedle Dumber. “Sometimes I wondered how it might go if I could just talk to them, calmly, explain that I didn’t life in a castle, my grandmother lived in a castle, that in fact Tweedle Dumb and Tweedle Dumber both had far grander lifestyles than mine. Billy (his security detail) had done a deep dive on their finances, so I knew. Each Tweedle owned multiple houses, and several luxury cars, purchased with proceeds from their photos of me and my family. (Offshore bank accounts too, like their sponsors, the media barons who funded them, chiefly Murdoch and the impossibly Dickensian-sounding Jonathan Harmsworth, 4th Viscount Rothermere.)”In this vulnerable memoir, you get a sense of a man who is trying to take control of his own life, and who is doing his best to protect his own family as an independent husband and father, which is what a responsible individual should do. Did he go into too much detail on some parts? Definitely. I know I didn’t need to know about his “todger”. But, it’s a memoir, and that’s the thing - it’s yours to craft, however that seems most prudent to you.From what I’ve read, and previously researched about the royal family and the insane protocols attached to them, it’s hard to fathom how one would be interested in trading places with any one of them. The archaic rules and laws attached to British royalty are contrary to every notion a responsible modern person holds dear in terms of independence of thought, opinion and action. That said, I think this royal memoir is a brilliant declaration of independence for Prince Harry. Like what he has to say or not, at least he’s now holding the reins.Show more",4,Im not much into celebrity culture and am ambivalent on the British royal family though I understand that so many

He obsessively weaves the press into every single one of his stories and it was exhausting. We know the British media are ruthless.

However, I’m very glad I read it and have A LOT of sympathy for Harry and Meghan. As much as I always say I should’ve been born a princess, it kinda sucks - being watched 24/7 is not the vibe and my mental health would NOT be ok if I had to go through what Meg did with the constant racist remarks from the British press.

Rating 1 out of 5,"Prince Harry, The Duke of Sussex, is a husband, father, humanitarian, military veteran, mental wellness advocate, and environmentalist. He resides in Santa Barbara, California, with his family and three dogs. Prince Harry wishes to support British charities with donations from his proceeds from Spare. The Duke of Sussex has donated $1,500,000 to Sentebale, an organization he founded with Prince Seeiso in their mothers’ legacies, which supports vulnerable children and young people in Lesotho and Botswana affected by HIV/AIDS. Prince Harry will also donate to the non-profit organization WellChild in the amount of £300,000. WellChild, which he has been Royal patron of for fifteen years, makes it possible for children and young people with complex health needs to be cared for at home instead of hospital, wherever possible.---The Spare’s side of the story.You’ve probably heard the stories already. The death of Diana … the royal scandals and controversies … Meghan Markle …These stories are everywhere. Unavoidable. Every day, there’s something in the news about Prince Harry, or someone in his family. Even if you’re not that interested in the royals, you can’t help but catch at least bits of their lives.So maybe you feel like you know Harry, and you already have an opinion of him. Perhaps you feel sorry for the man who lost his mother at a young age, in such tragic and public circumstances.Or you judge the man who once thought it was acceptable to dress up as a Nazi.You think Harry was right to cut ties with the royal family.Or you think he betrayed them.Whatever your opinion, and whatever you think you know, this book may change your mind. Reading about Harry in the papers is one thing. Hearing his side of the story is quite another.Of course, we won’t be able to explore the complex dynamics of all the royal relationships, or delve into the details of every scandal. There’s a lot to unpack. In an interview, Harry revealed that his 400-page memoir was originally twice as long, and that it was hard knowing what to leave out.So, in this book, we’ll focus on just a few important relationships and key moments from Harry’s life. You’ll get a glimpse of what it’s like to be a royal. And you’ll discover why Harry ended up essentially resigning from the family, and leaving the country.First though, maybe you’re wondering about that title. Why “Spare?” Well, that in itself is quite revealing.---As a royal, but also “the Spare,” Harry has had a uniquely abnormal life.On the day of Harry’s birth, Prince Charles allegedly said to Diana, “Wonderful! Now there’s an Heir and a Spare.” William was the firstborn – the heir to the throne – while Harry, the second son, was “the Spare.”Presumably, Charles’s comment was a joke. But Harry’s parents and grandparents often talked about him in this way, making it clear that he was the back-up. From an early age, Harry knew exactly what his role was. He was aware that his father and brother, who were first and second in line to the throne, could never take the same flight, in case the plane crashed. But there were no such rules for Harry. The Spare could be, well, spared.Harry says that he took no offense at this. He accepted his role in the family. But now, as an adult, reflecting on his family and his identity, he realizes just how abnormal his life has been.For instance, take his relationship with his father. Charles is not just Harry’s father, but also his boss and his banker. Or at least, he was, until Harry’s exit from royal life – we’ll get to that later. The point is, it’s not a typical father-son relationship.It’s true that when Harry was growing up, there were some normal, loving moments between them. Harry has fond memories of his father comforting him when he was a child. He used to be afraid of the dark, and at bedtime, Charles would sit beside him, gently tickling his face until he fell asleep. And he always called Harry his “darling boy.” But for the most part, Harry recalls his father being a distant parent, who found communicating difficult. Charles preferred to tell his son how proud he was through letters, left on Harry’s pillow, rather than face-to-face. And Charles wasn’t much of a hugger. In that, he seems to have taken after his mother, Queen Elizabeth. Apparently, she once swerved to avoid a hug from Diana – quite the awkward moment for them both!But a lack of physical affection was far from Harry’s only issue growing up. Because of his royal status, every attempt to lead a normal life was thwarted in some way. At school, he had armed bodyguards down the hall. When he was a teenager, they were waiting for him outside the pub, too. It’s hard to live anything resembling a normal existence when you have to be escorted by bodyguards everywhere you go. Public transport is out of the question, though Harry did take the Tube once, on a school trip. As an adult, Harry managed to enjoy occasional moments of freedom. For example, he would go to the supermarket on his own. But each outing was planned like a military operation. He would go in disguise – a loose coat and a low baseball cap – and at different times of day, to throw off the press. He even memorized the layout of the store, so he could get in and out as quickly as possible.Lack of freedom and privacy have been recurring issues in Harry’s life – a cause of stress and frustration. But of course, nothing has impacted him quite like the events of that night in August 1997.---It took Harry many years to come to terms with Diana’s death.Harry was 12 years old. In the middle of the night, he was woken up by his father coming into his room. “Darling boy,” said Charles, “Mummy was in a car crash.” Harry doesn’t remember exactly what was said next, but he recalls one phrase with total clarity – “She didn’t make it.”There was no hug. But his father patted him on the knee, and told him it was going to be okay.Harry didn’t cry that night. And it felt strange when, on the day of the funeral, he was forced to shake hands with countless sobbing strangers – people who had never met his mother. He felt guilty that they were crying, and he wasn’t. But when he did eventually break down in tears, as he watched the coffin descend, he felt embarrassed. Crying went against the family ethos, after all.Another reason for Harry’s confusion was that deep down, he didn’t believe his mother was really dead. She was hiding, he thought, or just playing dead for some reason.For years, he would say to himself, “Maybe this is the day she’ll reappear.”As long as there was no definitive proof of her death, Harry was able to believe she was still alive. But as an adult, he started to search for the truth. He asked his private secretary to get him the secret police files on the car crash.For the first time, Harry saw photos of the tunnel in Paris, and the smashed car. Some of the pictures had been taken by the police, but others, Harry realized, were paparazzi photos. Then he saw his mother. In the photos she was surrounded by golden lights, almost like halos. At first, he thought it was something supernatural. And then he realized – they were flashes. The lights were the flashes from the paparazzi’s cameras. The photographers had followed Diana into the tunnel, shooting and shooting, even as she lay dying.Seeing these photos didn’t give Harry a sense of closure. It just filled him with rage, and hatred for the paparazzi who had harassed her.And when Harry did find closure, in his early twenties, he almost wished he hadn’t. One night, while visiting Paris for the first time, he asked his driver to take him through the tunnel where his mother’s car had crashed.So they drove through the tunnel. Twice. And at last, Harry felt the truth sink in – his mother had really died. She was gone for good.But instead of ending the suffering, this realization led to a new phase of pain. For years, Harry struggled with his mental health – anxiety, panic attacks, feelings of rage.It was only when he was in his thirties that he finally started to get better. Therapy was a turning point.For one therapy session, Harry brought something with him – a bottle of his mother’s favorite perfume.He opened the lid, sniffed deeply, and the memories came flooding back. The sound of her laughter … At last, he remembered it. He could hear it, loud and clear.And he cried – this time, with joy.---The press have been targeting Harry since he was a teenager.Given the circumstances of his mother’s death, you can probably understand Harry’s hostility towards the press. For years, it’s been a mutually antagonistic relationship. The press may have been sympathetic to the bereaved 12-year-old, but not long after that, Harry was fair game.When he was in his teens, the tabloids published stories about him using drugs, and cheating in his school exams. They were total lies, but the accusations stuck.Other stories were true. There was the time Harry was photographed wearing a Nazi uniform to a fancy dress party. “What was he thinking?” people wanted to know. Well, he wasn’t thinking. It was a stupid mistake. Harry was mortified by his behavior, and the media attention that followed. Eventually, his error of judgment was forgiven and forgotten – more or less.But of course, the journalists and photographers were never going to leave Harry alone. The hardest part was always being watched and followed, wherever he went. He recognized some of the paparazzi by sight, because they followed him everywhere. There was no escape.It became so aggravating, Harry started to fantasize about punching paparazzi. To avoid the temptation, he had to avoid seeing them altogether. When leaving clubs and pubs, he would sometimes ask his bodyguard to stuff him in the boot of the car. As he was driven home, he would lie there in the dark, feeling like he was in a coffin. But it was better that way.Still, even if Harry managed to avoid having his photo taken every now and then, the stories kept coming and coming. Whenever Harry complained, his father would tell him to ignore the papers. “Darling boy,” said Charles. “Just don’t read it.” Easier said than done, of course. And the advice was a little ironic coming from Charles, considering his own dealings with the media.Remember Harry’s teenage drug scandal? The story was splashed across the papers, despite the fact that there was no truth in it. Shockingly, Harry later discovered why the story was published. His father’s spin doctor had made a deal with the newspaper editor. Yes, that’s right. Indirectly, Charles had collaborated with the press, and agreed to let them publish a negative story about his son. Why? Because it was good for Charles’s own reputation in the media, which wasn’t doing too well at the time.“Charles as an unfaithful husband” – not a good angle. “Charles as a single father struggling with his drug-abusing child” – much better. For Charles, anyway.And in hindsight, this incident would seem like a warning sign of things to come.---Harry’s girlfriends have also had to endure constant press harassment.With the press watching Harry’s every movement, it was inevitable – any woman he dated would also end up being followed by the paparazzi. And while Harry was used to the harassment, it was a shock to his girlfriends. Once, his girlfriend Chelsy found a tracking device on her car. She told Harry that she wasn’t sure if she could cope with a lifetime of being stalked. Harry understood perfectly. So they broke up.There were similar conversations with other girlfriends. It was so frustrating, as Harry wanted to be in a relationship, and have a family one day. But it was too much to ask of a partner – putting up with the constant stalking and harassment.In 2016, when Harry started dating the American actress Meghan Markle, things got even worse. First, there were the stories in the papers. Meghan’s family were labeled “gangsters.” There were countless snide comments about Meghan’s background and race, and her “rich and exotic DNA,” to quote one journalist. What would happen if a royal had a child with a woman who was mixed-race? Harry was appalled by the racism and snobbery. He hadn’t expected it to be this bad.Then, of course, there was the harassment. It was relentless. Meghan was followed everywhere, as were her friends and family. Journalists camped outside Meghan’s house and rang the doorbell non-stop, driving her poor dogs crazy.One time, Meghan called Harry in tears. She was driving home from work, on the icy roads of Ontario, and being chased by five cars. They were all around her, tailgating, cutting her off. Meghan was convinced she was going to crash. And Harry, listening on the phone from London, felt helpless. He was transported back to his childhood – memories of his mother’s car crash, and his father saying, “She didn’t make it.” In the end, Meghan made it home safely, though no thanks to the police. She was a public figure, they told her. There was nothing they could do. And the press harassment went on and on.A couple of years later, when Harry and Meghan were married, and Meghan was pregnant with her first child, there was a low point. Harry came home to find Meghan sobbing on the stairs. “I don’t want to do this any more,” she said. “Do what?” Harry asked.“Live,” said Meghan.That’s how bad it got. She was so distressed by the constant harassment of her and her family, she had suicidal thoughts.Harry did his best to comfort Meghan. They would find a solution, he promised her.But in the meantime, they had an engagement to get to – an event at the Royal Albert Hall in London. And they couldn’t be late, because Meghan would be blamed, as always.So they went. When they got out of the car, they stepped into the blinding lights of the flashbulbs, and took each other’s hands.And when they were inside the venue and the lights were dimmed for the performance, Meghan let the tears flow.---Harry was disappointed by the lack of support from his family.“I’ll keep you safe.” This was Harry’s promise to Meghan, that night at the Royal Albert Hall. But how? What could he do to protect her?One option was legal action. When a newspaper published a private letter of Meghan’s, Harry realized that this was an opportunity to make a stand – he would sue.His father and brother had both sued the press in the past. But when Harry told them of his intentions, they tried to talk him out of it. It wasn’t a good idea, they said. Not the done thing.Harry and Meghan sued anyway.And not long after, Harry was summoned to Buckingham Palace. His father told him that his legal action was incredibly damaging to the royal family’s reputation. Harry defended himself. Suing was the only option, he said. It wouldn’t have been necessary if the family had done something to protect him and Meghan. All those hateful articles in the press, all those insults on social media … And the royal family hadn’t said a word, either publicly or in private. Even when Harry and Meghan begged them for help.To add insult to injury, Harry suspected that certain members of the family were actually working with the press. It had happened before, remember – when Charles’s staff approved the publication of the invented story about Harry’s drug use.In 2020, Harry and Meghan decided to leave the UK, and step away from royal duties. The news was leaked to the press before Harry and Meghan had had the chance to release an official statement. And the news story included a particularly telling detail – that the couple had offered to give up their Sussex titles. There was only one document that mentioned this detail – a private letter from Harry to his father. And there were very, very few people who could have possibly had access to that letter.So, it’s no wonder Harry and Meghan ended up leaving the country, and cutting ties to a certain extent. The press harassment was never-ending. And Harry couldn’t depend on his family for support or protection.The final details of Harry and Meghan’s departure were hashed out in a meeting with the royal family, where they discussed the different options. Harry was keen to find a compromise while retaining security. Above all, he wanted to keep his family safe. The other attendees at the meeting argued for an “all-or-nothing” approach. You’re either a regular royal with all the perks and security, they said, or you give it all up.But in the end, the royals made a deal. Harry and Meghan would be allowed to keep their security, at least for the time being. After the meeting, the Palace made a statement that Harry and Meghan would “step back,” no longer formally representing the Queen.The papers were outraged, of course. Harry and Meghan’s actions were described as “insults” and “crimes.”But Harry had no regrets. And two years later, living in California, he knew he had made the right decision for himself and his family – Meghan and his two children.As for Harry’s other family members, his feelings are mixed, to say the least. He loves them, of course, and always will. He just wishes that in one of the darkest moments of his life, they had been there for him.---Reflecting on his life so far, Harry recognizes that there’s a common theme in nearly all his problems – the press, and their obsession with tormenting members of the royal family, and turning them against each other. What a shame that it had to come to this – Harry and Meghan feeling compelled to flee the country.But there have also been victories along the way, like Harry finally coming to terms with the loss of his mother. And of course, he found love, and started a family of his own – something that once seemed out of reach. Harry may be “the Spare,” but more importantly, he’s also the one who broke free, and started living life on his own terms.Show more",1,Prince Harry The Duke of Sussex is a husband father humanitarian military veteran mental wellness advocate and environmentalist He resides in Santa Barbara

be cared for at home instead of hospital wherever possibleThe Spares side of the storyYouve probably heard the stories already The death of Diana  the royal scandals and controversies  Meghan Markle These stories are everywhere Unavoidable Every day theres something in the news about Prince Harry or someone in his family Even if youre not that interested in the royals you cant help but catch at least bits of their livesSo maybe you feel like you know Harry and you already have an opinion of him Perhaps you feel sorry for the man who lost his mother at a young age in such tragic and public circumstancesOr you judge the man who once thought it was acceptable to dress up as a NaziYou think Harry was right to cut ties with the royal familyOr you think he betrayed themWhatever your opinion and whatever you think you know this book may change your mind Reading about Harry in the papers is one thing Hearing his side of the story is quite anotherOf course we wont be able to explore the complex dynamics of all the royal relationships or delve into the details of every scandal Theres a lot to unpack In an interview Harry revealed that his 400page memoir was originally twice as long and that it was hard knowing what to leave outSo in this book well focus on just a few important relationships and key moments from Harrys life Youll get a glimpse of what its like to be a royal And youll discover why Harry ended up essentially resigning from the family and leaving the countryFirst though maybe youre wondering about that title Why Spare Well that in itself is quite revealingAs a royal but also the Spare Harry has had a uniquely abnormal lifeOn the day of Harrys birth Prince Charles allegedly said to Diana Wonderful Now theres an Heir and a Spare William was the firstborn  the heir to the throne  while Harry the second son was the SparePresumably Charless comment was a joke But Harrys parents and grandparents often talked about him in this way making it clear that he was the backup From an early age Harry knew exactly what his role was He was aware that his father and brother who were first and second in line to the throne could never take the same flight in case the plane crashed But there were no such rules for Harry The Spare could be well sparedHarry says that he took no offense at this He accepted his role in the family But now as an adult reflecting on his family and his identity he realizes just how abnormal his life has beenFor instance take his relationship with his father Charles is not just Harrys father but also his boss and his banker Or at least he was until Harrys exit from royal life  well get to that later The point is its not a typical fatherson relationshipIts true that when Harry was growing up there were some normal loving moments between them Harry has fond memories of his father comforting him when he was a child He used to be afraid of the dark and at bedtime Charles would sit beside him gently tickling his face until he fell asleep And he always called Harry his darling boy But for the most part Harry recalls his father being a distant parent who found communicating difficult Charles preferred to tell his son how proud he was through letters left on Harrys pillow rather than facetoface And Charles wasnt much of a hugger In that he seems to have taken after his mother Queen Elizabeth Apparently she once swerved to avoid a hug from Diana  quite the awkward moment for them bothBut a lack of physical affection was far from Harrys only issue growing up Because of his royal status every attempt to lead a normal life was thwarted in some way At school he had armed bodyguards down the hall When he was a teenager they were waiting for him outside the pub too Its hard to live anything resembling a normal existence when you have to be escorted by bodyguards everywhere you go Public transport is out of the question though Harry did take the Tube once on a school trip As an adult Harry managed to enjoy occasional moments of freedom For example he would go to the supermarket on his own But each outing was planned like a military operation He would go in disguise  a loose coat and a low baseball cap  and at different times of day to throw off the press He even memorized the layout of the store so he could get in and out as quickly as possibleLack of freedom and privacy have been recurring issues in Harrys life  a cause of stress and frustration But of course nothing has impacted him quite like the events of that night in August 1997It took Harry many years to come to terms with Dianas deathHarry was 12 years old In the middle of the night he was woken up by his father coming into his room Darling boy said Charles Mummy was in a car crash Harry doesnt remember exactly what was said next but he recalls one phrase with total clarity  She didnt make itThere was no hug But his father patted him on the knee and told him it was going to be okayHarry didnt cry that night And it felt strange when on the day of the funeral he was forced to shake hands with countless sobbing strangers  people who had never met his mother He felt guilty that they were crying and he wasnt But when he did eventually break down in tears as he watched the coffin descend he felt embarrassed Crying went against the family ethos after allAnother reason for Harrys confusion was that deep down he didnt believe his mother was really dead She was hiding he thought or just playing dead for some reasonFor years he would say to himself Maybe this is the day shell reappearAs long as there was no definitive proof of her death Harry was able to believe she was still alive But as an adult he started to search for the truth He asked his private secretary to get him the secret police files on the car crashFor the first time Harry saw photos of the tunnel in Paris and the smashed car Some of the pictures had been taken by the police but others Harry realized were paparazzi photos Then he saw his mother In the photos she was surrounded by golden lights almost like halos At first he thought it was something supernatural And then he realized  they were flashes The lights were the flashes from the paparazzis cameras The photographers had followed Diana into the tunnel shooting and shooting even as she lay dyingSeeing these photos didnt give Harry a sense of closure It just filled him with rage and hatred for the paparazzi who had harassed herAnd when Harry did find closure in his early twenties he almost wished he hadnt One night while visiting Paris for the first time he asked his driver to take him through the tunnel where his mothers car had crashedSo they drove through the tunnel Twice And at last Harry felt the truth sink in  his mother had really died She was gone for goodBut instead of ending the suffering this realization led to a new phase of pain For years Harry struggled with his mental health  anxiety panic attacks feelings of rageIt was only when he was in his thirties that he finally started to get better Therapy was a turning pointFor one therapy session Harry brought something with him  a bottle of his mothers favorite perfumeHe opened the lid sniffed deeply and the memories came flooding back The sound of her laughter  At last he remembered it He could hear it loud and clearAnd he cried  this time with joyThe press have been targeting Harry since he was a teenagerGiven the circumstances of his mothers death you can probably understand Harrys hostility towards the press For years its been a mutually antagonistic relationship The press may have been sympathetic to the bereaved 12yearold but not long after that Harry was fair gameWhen he was in his teens the tabloids published stories about him using drugs and cheating in his

Rating 2 out of 5,"Complete lack of self awareness. Where do I begin? I doubt very much Harry actually wrote this book. The style is very similar to a bad romantic novel, with shades of a thriller thrown in.Indeed, the book is at its best when describing Harry's military service, a time in his life where he appeared to be genuinely happy.But overall the reader is left with the impression of resentment (that Harry is the spare, not heir). William is cast in a bad light, Charles and Camelia not much better. The description of Charles doing handstands in his boxer shorts is not one I will forget in a hurry. Neither, for that matter, reading about how Harry suffered from a frost bitten penis!Not a biography I would recommend.

Rating 3 out of 5,"⁣⭐️⭐️⭐️💫(book not the content)At 400+ pages, I felt the book was too long & needed some editing. P1, mostly Harry’s childhood often read like a disorganized (I realize it was chronological)set of memories, often with no real purpose behind the story.

I always believed they had a great relationship/friendship, but perhaps not.A lot of Harry’s complaints about his brother are basic sibling stuff-as the Spare, Harry feels like second best; as the younger child I think he expected more from his brother.

Rating 3 out of 5,"Hmm. Overall: I’m glad I read it, but this was hard to get through. The writing is not great, and even I (avid royal fan) found myself bored at times.It was long. Like, not just that it was 400 pages. 🙃 It’s split into 3 parts: when Diana died till he graduated high school, time in the military, and after he met Meghan. Part one was interesting-ish, since we didn’t know most of it… though the constant drug/alcohol stories (with no ownership/regret.. almost boastful?) bothered me. Part two was extremely boring. Haha. I’m not much of a military reader, and it was incredibly detailed… probably could have been like a couple chapters? But it’s what matters to him- I get it- I just… was bored.Part three is almost identical to the Netflix documentary, with a few added interesting tidbits. A few. There’s a lot of “shocking” stories about his relationship with William and Kate. But can you imagine being in a family business with your siblings? It’s not hard to then imagine these stories haha. The press stories were awful. I hate that for them.This book won’t change anyone’s opinion I don’t think. Clearly I have some, but I’m just trying to review the book for what it is!

Rating 4 out of 5,"This book made me more sad than anything. It was a bit entitled at times, appalling at others. I don’t always agree with Harry’s assessment of things, however, I was not there so I hardly get any opinion on the matter. He says it towards the end of the book, of it being a dysfunctional family in this extraordinary situation. That’s what I saw. It’s saddens me to think of the lines drawn between family for the sake of pride, righteousness and tradition. Wishing Harry and his family all the best and the rest of the family as well. Someday peace would be a beautiful thing, it’s what their mother would have wanted for them.Show more",4,This book made me more sad than anything It was a bit entitled at times appalling at others I dont always agree with Harrys assessment of things however I was not there so I hardly get any opinion on the matter He says it towards the end of the book of it being a dysfunctional family in this extraordinary situation Thats what I saw Its saddens me to think of the lines drawn between family for the sake of pride righteousness and tradition Wishing Harry and his family all the best and the rest of the family as well Someday peace would be a beautiful thing its what their mother would have wanted for themShow more

Rating 1 out of 5,"It is very difficult to separate this book from the larger context it was written in, but I will attempt to write my review based on the merits of the book rather than my opinion about the latest Royal Family news story. I do often read Royal Family news so I would say that I am a reader who is decently informed about current royal events. I watch The Crown (which I recognize is fiction), but I did not watch the infamous Oprah interview with Harry and Meghan nor did I watch the Netflix documentary. I read this book mostly because of the hype around it and because I wanted to know what the book actually says rather than the snippets taken out of context for news stories and therefore, I suspect, over-sensationalized. The memoir begins with the death of Princess Diana, Prince Harry’s mother, which is understandably a huge defining moment in Harry’s life. It then goes on to detail his turbulent adolescence dealing with his grief (or, avoiding dealing with it), his career in the army, stories about his partying lifestyle and various relationships, and then lastly he details his relationship with Meghan Markle, their marriage, and their decision to leave their roles in the royal family. At first the book seems to be Harry using the writing of the memoir both as a means to figure himself out and to explain to the reader why he is the way he is. I would have liked there to be more about his childhood, but he mentions that a lot of memories of childhood were blocked out because of grief. I don’t think that much of this part seemed very extraordinary. Certainly Princess Diana being a public figure and her death being such a public spectacle is out of the ordinary, but Harry’s grief seems pretty normal, I guess? I don’t say that to diminish it at all, but just to say that reading about it didn’t seem to stray off (from what I know) the charts of familiar grieving territory. So it certainly helped in understanding his viewpoint about a lot of things and also generated sympathy, but there isn’t a lot to comment on here. Besides the fact that, yeah, his family probably should have taken him to therapy. This part of the book seemed the most like a memoir. As he moves on to his later years, in between the too-detailed stories about his penis and the boring, timeline-esque retelling of his time in the army (first I went here. Then I trained on this. Then I went here. Then I trained on this. Then I did this mission. Then I moved to this mission. Then I trained on something new.) the tone shifts from one of self-examination and explanation to one of curated reputation control. He touches on many of his scandalous moments, but always with an air of innocence: I didn’t know any better, other people betrayed me to the press, this wasn’t as big a deal as it was made out to be, they are the ones who did wrong, etc. It becomes very clear that he can’t stand any negative misconceptions about him, and even misconceptions from years past must be given his version that paints him in a much better light (and those around him worse off). For example, he discusses the incident where he wore a Nazi uniform to costume party. He explains it as innocently “not thinking” and later calls it a lack of self-education but also places the blame on his brother and sister-in-law, who approved of the costume. Similarly, in the incident where he called an army friend a racial slur, he writes that he didn't know any better (other people said it, he was ""awash in privilege and isolation"") and wanted to put out an apology statement--not because he may have hurt his friend, but because he didn't want people to think he was racist. But the big bad palace machine wouldn't let him, so there goes another negative story that must be righted years later. He says he cares about ""not being racist"" and certainly that is a good goal, but in his description of the phone call with his friend where Harry apologizes, he recounts his friend forgiving him by saying ""I know you're not a racist."" It's about Harry not being a racist (aka his public image) rather than whatever hurt he may have caused his friend. I can understand that it is hard to have your every move (and every speculated move) documented for your whole life and that it would be annoying to have other people always having the wrong perception of you, but reading about all his grievances and the complicit roles others had in his scandals got annoyingly repetitive. And do we ever see that he grows up and realizes you CAN’T control what other people think of you, famous or not, even if you are constantly shouting your truth from the rooftops and that it is better for everyone to just be above it all, live your life, and not care? No, the reader does not. Because then Meghan Markle enters the picture. Now, I should point that I didn’t really have much of an opinion of Meghan Markle before reading this book. I still don’t really have much of an opinion, because what was a tone of carefully curated public image damage control suddenly turned into a full on PR campaign on Meghan’s behalf so I honestly don’t know if I can trust this narrative. It becomes clear that THIS was the entire point of writing the book, not the dabbling in self-examination from the beginning pages that may have fooled the reader into thinking they would actually be reading a memoir. Harry spends the first half of the book building his case against the press so that he could then go through point by point, headline by headline, to list every single sin the press has committed against Meghan and rail against them for his presumed sympathetic reader, not realizing that he has probably lost the sympathy of his reader with all the whining about how everyone has wronged him. Anyway, the PR campaign. Meghan is presented as the innocent and friendly outsider, so endearing in her American ways. His version of her is the epitome of the Not Like Other Girls trope. She is noble yet humble. Perfectly classy and elegant, regal even, but also perfectly at home in the African bush. I believe that he loves his wife and wants to defend her against the unjustified attacks of the press. And yes, many of those attacks are heinous. But presenting her as the perfect woman whose main sin is wearing ripped jeans at home comes across as nauseating. It’s particularly nauseating because his defense of his wife comes at the expense of his family, dragging them through the mud when they can't defend themselves, which is what he has whined about happening to him for the entire book. He tells stories about his family, making assumptions about motives to “prove” that his entire family is out to get him and poor, innocent Meghan. To be honest, a lot of the so-called tensions between Meghan and his family seem like cultural and/or personality differences that, with a history of being paranoid about what other people think, spiraled into an obsession with thinking the family members were being snobs at best and malicious at worst. For example, Harry talks about the time he, Meghan, his brother William, and sister-in-law Kate were to appear on stage together. The press picked up on some apparent tension between the two couples and ran with it, speculating about what was going on behind the scenes. Never fear, we have Harry to gossip narrate what happened for us! Right before they were to appear on stage, Meghan asked to borrow some of Kate’s lip gloss! Kate was annoyed! Clearly she thought that Meghan was a dumb newbie who was also maliciously intent on destroying the monarchy and clearly not worth Kate's time! But did it ever occur to Harry that rather than Kate feeling animosity toward Megan that a possible explanation could be that BORROWING MAKEUP IS GROSS NO MATTER HOW YOU APPLY IT and that maybe Kate was uncomfortable with sharing but didn’t know how to say no, given the fact that they were about to go on stage and she didn’t want to make it awkward? That’s the first thought that came into my mind because it’s exactly how I would have reacted. He's willing to give himself that innocent ""you can't blame me because I didn't know better"" explanation when he is doing actually racist things, but he's not willing to give Kate the benefit of the doubt when she doesn't want to share lip gloss? I don't deny that being a part of the royal family does seem terrible. And certainly the way the royal family is treated by the press also seems terrible. But reading this list of grievances (can we even call it a memoir anymore?) is just so tedious. Any sympathy that may have been garnered in the beginning is lost. The main takeaway about Harry after reading this is that he is whiny, entitled, and petty. Oh so petty. My other main takeaway is that the monarchy is pretty useless. What do they actually do besides be a living soap opera? I'm American, so maybe I just don't get it.Lastly, I was really annoyed by Harry's attitude and tone toward Africa. It seemed very white savior-ish and condescending. He uses it as an exotic location where he feels so in touch with nature and himself, as if it exists to serve him. He even argues with William at one point about who can ""have"" Africa as a charitable cause. It was a big turn off.Show more",1,It is very difficult to separate this book from the larger context it was written in but I will attempt to write my review based on the merits of the book rather

Rating 5 out of 5,"I have listened to this memoir on Audible.I love biographies, especially when they are read by the author, so a big plus for that.The story of Prince Harry's life is honest, emotional and raw. Having recently read Open by Andre Agassi, I have found the format of the book, similar, with short chapters and entertaining. The same author J.R. Moehringer who helped Agassi write this book helped Harry.He suffered a lot and the trauma of loosing his mother so young will never heal completely even with the help he gets from his therapists. I dont know any one who can endure to walk behind his mother coffin and not cry at all.The only part that I did not like it was the peace of the reading, I found it too slow, so I have listen to this book on 1.8 speed and worked just fine for me. Also the second part of the book contains in my opinion too much information from his army life, but I enjoyed that part too.I admire the author for the courage of putting his life, his dramas , his suffering and family issues out in a book.The part I liked the most was his story of childhood, how he played with his brother Willy and also the part when he meat his wife Meghan and he describes his love and romance. I think the love for his family can be felt by how he calls his father (Pa), his brother (Willy), his grandmother the queen (Grand).The author presents also parts in his life that were very difficult: the death of his mother, the death of his Granny, the death of his Grandfather and the troubles caused by the press articles and news.As for the family issues that led the to give up royalty I think there are always two sides of the story, and the truth is always somewhere in the middle even if we like it or not.I am glad he told his story and hope this was therapeutic in the way he needs.I recommend this book for everyone who thinks royal like is dreamy and pink!Show more",5,I have listened to this memoir on AudibleI love biographies especially when they are read by the author so a big plus for thatThe story of Prince Harrys life is honest emotional and raw Having recently read Open by Andre Agassi I have found the format of the book similar with short chapters and entertaining The same author JR Moehringer who helped Agassi write this book helped HarryHe suffered a lot and the trauma of loosing his mother so young will never heal completely even with the help he gets from his therapists I dont know any one who can endure to walk behind his mother coffin and not cry at allThe only part that I did not like it was the peace of the reading I found it too slow so I have listen to this book on 18 speed and worked just fine for me Also the second part of the book contains in my opinion too much information from his army life but I enjoyed that part tooI admire the author for the courage of putting his life his dramas  his suffering and family issues out in a bookThe part I liked the most was his story of childhood how he played with his brother Willy and also the part when he meat his wife Meghan and he describes his love and romance I think the love for his family can be felt by how he calls his father Pa his brother Willy his grandmother the queen GrandThe author presents also parts in his life that were very difficult the death of his mother the death of his Granny the death of his Grandfather and the troubles caused by the press articles and newsAs for the family issues that led the to give up royalty I think there are always two sides of the story and the truth is always somewhere in the middle even if we like it or notI am glad he told his story and hope this was therapeutic in the way he needsI recommend this book for everyone who thinks royal like is dreamy and pinkShow more
Rating 4 out of 5,"4 StarsPrince Harry has been kinder and more forgiving towards his brother and father than they deserve, and he still loves them both. But he's setting healthy boundaries and sticking to them. Good for him.Charles and William are what happen when a person is raised to believe the following: they are superior to others simply because they are royal, are entitled to use and abuse others without consequences, should be the center of attention at all times, are owed absolute obedience even when they're wrong, and should be given whatever they want simply because they demand it. Neither of these men is an adult. They're petulant, whiny, self pitying, manipulative, dishonest, profoundly selfish, egotistical, and in the case of William, a full on bully. The press, particularly the royal rota, should be ashamed of themselves but that will never happen. The British press print lies without blinking an eye so they can sell newspapers and get more views on their websites. As long as there's money to be made, they won't stop. This system killed Diana, the mother of Harry and William, yet they feel no guilt or responsibility. The racism, misogyny and xenophobia in the hit pieces they print should be a source of deep shame for their profession and disgust for the British people. I think it's safe to say Diana would be very angry at what has been done to her sons. Neither received the guidance they needed to navigate the world as functional adults.

Rating 5 out of 5,"Early on in reading Spare by Prince Harry, I mused that his life sounded like a real-life version of the movie The Truman Show. If you haven’t seen that movie, you might want to view it. I was stunned when near the end of the book he summarized his life as being just that. I think if anything depicts the life of a Royal in the modern day, that seems to be it.Spare is written in the first person by Harry, and how he remembers things. He admits early on his memory is faulty. Having suffered myself with a traumatic brain injury and PTSD myself, I sympathize. You don’t remember things in the right order all the time and sometimes you don’t get details right. Not only did his mother’s death and time in Afghanistan give him PTSD, but while reading this his whole life was predicated to suffering from that.Harry spills what he knows, and many people aren’t happy about that. In particular, his details about the palace’s adversarial but cooperative relationship with the British tabloids are detailed here. He blames them for his mother’s death and for many other misfortunes. Again, near the end, he talks about how one of the women he briefly dated couldn’t cope with the attention from the paparazzi (or paps as he calls them), and although she broke off the relationship, she never recovered and ended up taking her own life. That is how serious the mental toll of these alleged “journalists” is.To read my full review, please go to: https://thoughtsfromthemountaintop.co...Show more",5,Early on in reading Spare by Prince Harry I mused that his life sounded like a reallife version of the movie The Truman Show If you havent seen that movie you might want to view it I was stunned when near the end of the book he summarized his life as being just that I think if anything depicts the life of a Royal in the modern day that seems to be itSpare is written in the first person by Harry and how he remembers things He admits early on his memory is faulty Having suffered myself with a traumatic brain injury and PTSD myself I sympathize You dont remember things in the right order all the time and sometimes you dont get details right Not only did his mothers death and time in Afghanistan give him PTSD but while reading this his whole life was predicated to suffering from thatHarry spills what he knows and many people arent happy about that In particular his details about the palaces adversarial but cooperative relationship with the British tabloids are detailed here He blames them for his mothers death and for many other misfortunes Again near the end he talks about how one of the women he briefly dated couldnt cope with the attention from the paparazzi or paps as he calls them and although she broke off the relationship she never recovered and ended up taking her own life That is how serious the mental toll of these alleged journalists isTo read my full review please go to httpsthoughtsfromthemountaintopcoShow more
Rating 5 out of 5,"The audio version was the way to go, there is just something extra about listening to Prince Harry fact-checking and telling his own story. With that boyish charm he is known/loved for, he details the last 25ish years of his life. A fascinating mix of humor, insecurity, betrayal, loss, drug usage, living your life in the public eye, and all the trauma he has endured. One of my favorite bits of his story was Prince Harry realizing his own faults. When he first tells the nazi costume story, it seems like a ""well that's what my brother told me to wear, and comes off as blaming my sibling for my actions"" but when he revisits that moment later in life, he reflects on how his own education (and not just schooling, but education about his own biases) being a fault for his choice to wear the costume. The last bit of his story is oddly relatable for anyone that has sought mental health treatment in a family opposed to it - the family that says, you've changed, you're being brainwashed, it didn't happen like that, etc... and the bonds that break.Show more",5,The audio version was the way to go there is just something extra about listening to Prince Harry factchecking and telling his own story With that boyish charm he is knownloved for he details the last 25ish years of his life A fascinating mix of humor insecurity betrayal loss drug usage living your life in the public eye and all the trauma he has endured One of my favorite bits of his story was Prince Harry realizing his own faults When he first tells the nazi costume story it seems like a well thats what my brother told me to wear and comes off as blaming my sibling for my actions but when he revisits that moment later in life he reflects on how his own education and not just schooling but education about his own biases being a fault for his choice to wear the costume The last bit of his story is oddly relatable for anyone that has sought mental health treatment in a family opposed to it  the family that says youve changed youre being brainwashed it didnt happen like that etc and the bonds that breakShow more
Rating 5 out of 5,"4.5/5I really liked this. Prince Harry opened up about how his mother's death and its aftermath has traumatized him. It's hard not to feel deeply for someone who has gone through an ordeal so painful. I wish I knew a little less about the conflicts between Prince Harry and the rest of the Royal Family. Some of it was really uncomfortable to hear, and I definitely feel like he over-shared at times. But I LOVED the stories about Meghan and their life together, and his memories of Princess Diana and Queen Elizabeth. It was well-written and entertaining, and I was engaged with the book during every minute of this listen. Audiobook Notes: Prince Harry reads it himself, and it is glorious to hear it all from his own mouth. I strongly urge everyone to listen to this book.

Rating 1 out of 5,"This is a difficult review to write, despite the book being a very easy read. It’s not that I don’t feel a certain sympathy for the issues was raised. It’s not that I don’t share at least some of the opinions expressed. It’s the context that galls, and, within that, the almost total self- absorption of its subject.At 440 pages or so, Prince Harry’s Spare is a substantial book. But the sentences are short.The paragraphs are often single sentences.Italics usually imply verbatim speech. I wonder if it’s quotable.So it is an easy read.There is a sense throughout that the author is pouring out his heart, getting things off his chest. There are many things, clearly one particular thing, that he never came to terms with, and perhaps still hasn’t.Harry Windsor, or Henry Charles Albert David Saxe-Coburg Gotha to give him his full royal name, was born into the British Royal Family as the second son of now, King Charles III. People may have missed the publicity of the last decade, but he is now an estranged family member, a stripped Royal, no longer fulfilling official duties, and no longer receiving the associated security cover that he clearly thinks he needs. Hence the necessity now to make a few bob. Hence Spare, the biography thus far.Now, I don’t want to deal with any of the detail, any of the events described, factual, or otherwise, in the review. The reader of this book will not want me to issue spoilers. The book is well written, is readable and gives a vivid picture of a life less than normal.But a principal theme, which reappears so many times it becomes repetitive, is Harry’s distaste for, and out-and-out vilification of the British press, and in certain cases the broadcast media as well. The book was prompted by the split that happened after his romance and marriage to Meghan Markle, an American, no less. Again the detail is all in the book. The basis of Harry’s dislike of the press is the role they played in the hounding of his mother, a practice, which he thinks, at least contributed to her death in a road accident, when the car she was traveling in, was pursued by paparazzi on motorbikes.Harry regularly refers to the press as liars, fabricators, who dredge dirt to sell newspapers. He cites Rupert Murdoch’s editors having hacked telephones for stories, and other mechanisms for inflating the currency of gossip. On the other hand, he describes discovering dope and other substances Eton. And just for accuracy sake, the author’s claim that Eton was the first school in the world for boys is obviously wrong. When the press reported he was using drugs, he called them liars. He regularly describes himself as drinking too much. When the press says he got drunk, again they are liars. He regularly labels himself is not the most academic person. When the press called him thick, he calls them liars. The choice of word is a little harsh, one might concede. So, with all these falsehoods building up into crises, you can always turn to the therapist or nip off to Botswana for a few days. Just like the rest of us.What will stoke the press fires from the text of Spare is the detail that Harry gives about his relations with his family, especially with his brother and his father. There is no suggestion whatsoever that the publication in this book was designed to provide the press with the gossip they needed. Again, if you are interested, read the book. But such revelations come as no surprise, however. It is surely a family habit. It seems that the royal family regularly manage the media presence via briefings and gossip. So what’s new? Haven’t they always done that? Haven’t they always had a love-hate relationship with their essential press? George IV, especially when he was the future king, had a serious problem with the press, which generally vilified him, branded him a drunken, lascivious glutton. But could they unseat him from the throne? Of course not. So, who has the real power?Spare’s revelations about the behaviour of Prince William, another future king, will be the ones that endure. Of course, this is only one side of the story, but will we ever hear the other side? You bet we will, but only via the gossip and the asides that seem to be the public face of this family.Harry still wants to ask his brother questions about what happened. Could I suggest he includes seeking an explanation of why former Labour Prime Ministers were not invited to William and Kate’s wedding. The non-Knight of the Garter story won’t wash. Ask your dad about his bash. What do you have if you don’t have tradition? And when, perhaps, might we be briefed how your wedding was a private occasion when the state paid out $32 million for the security arrangements? The choice you made will mean that many people who did not vote Tory will never regard you was having the right to call yourself King. You chose to rule over only a selected a bunch of the British people, not the nation.If Spare had addressed questions such as this, it would have been more interesting. As it is, it’s a young man’s limited experience of life exposed in all its self-glorification. I read a friend’s copy by the way, so no royalties from me.Show more",1,This is a difficult review to write despite the book being a very easy read Its not that I dont feel a certain sympathy for the

Rating 3 out of 5,"The Royal Family sits at the nexus of Western Civilization’s meta-narrative, to say the least. History itself is an exercise in storytelling. And whoever tells the most compelling story has the most power. That has always been the case. Shakespeare himself knew how important narrative was when shaping history. Shakespeare legitimized the monarchy through narrative.So it makes perfect sense that Harry would use narrative as his modern day weapon of war. He really is no different from, say Henry VII, who took Richard III’s crown on the battlefield (according to the most compelling narrative). I mean, isn’t that essentially what Harry is doing here? He’s an angry younger son, like most “spares” in royal life have always been. Like Richard III. And, by the way, if Willy and Harry took their beef to the battlefield, Harry would totally win, crown himself over his brother’s bleeding carcass and found the House of Sussex. I think the biggest takeaway from this story is the fact that the press and pretty much all journalists are trash. They are garbage. I do not doubt for one moment every claim Harry makes about their dirty tricks and about his absolute hatred of them. The press is evil. We live in an age where the corporate press has profited from lying to the people on a regular basis about everything under the sun, all for cash, clicks, and entertainment. It’s all fake news, man. And this is basically Harry railing against “fake news” and the idiots (like myself, I suppose) who consume it. My last little point here is regarding Harry’s ghostwriter. He deserves a ton of credit. This memoir is beautifully written, and I thoroughly enjoyed all the little allusions to Dickens, Wordsworth, Shakespeare, Steinbeck, and his supposed favorite, Faulkner (regardless if he admits to getting the last from ""Brainy Quotes""). It’s hilarious how Harry says straight up that he barely got out of Eton, doesn’t read literature, isn’t “book-ish” at all, then in the next breath discusses the “Dickensian” elements of British life and the craggy cliffs in the Lake District with allusions to Wordsworth. “Not that I read any of that tripe when I was in school,” he basically “says” in another breath. It’s his ghostwriter’s ectoplasm oozing between the lines. That would be such an interesting job, wouldn’t it? Taking people’s life stories and spinning them into a cohesive narrative? Most people have no idea how to go about doing that themselves, and I for one think that our actual storytellers (in this case Pulitzer prize winner JR Moehringer) really deserve the credit. Storytellers, narrative spinners–they have the power, they are the ones who shape reality or at least people’s perception of it. And with that in mind, Harry and Megs definitely won this round. They wrestled their story away from the “Paps” and the tabloids and everyone else who is trying to use their story for their own purposes and decided to tell it their way. Bold move. That said, they are still a bunch of entitled whiny brats and need to go away.Show more",3,The Royal Family sits at the nexus of Western Civilizations metanarrative to say the least History itself is an exercise in storytelling And whoever tells the most compelling story has the most power That has always been the case Shakespeare himself knew how important narrative was when shaping history Shakespeare legitimized the monarchy through narrativeSo it makes perfect sense that Harry would use narrative as his modern day weapon of war He really is no different from say Henry VII who took Richard IIIs crown on the battlefield according to the most compelling narrative I mean isnt that essentially what Harry is doing here Hes an angry younger son like most spares in royal life have always been Like Richard III And by the way if Willy and Harry took their beef to the battlefield Harry would totally win crown himself over his brothers bleeding carcass and found the House of Sussex I think the biggest takeaway from this story is the fact that the press and pretty much all journalists are trash They are garbage I do not doubt for one moment every claim Harry makes about their dirty tricks and about his absolute hatred of them The press is evil We live in an age where the corporate press has profited from lying to the people on a regular basis about everything under the sun all for cash clicks and entertainment Its all fake news man And this is basically Harry railing against fake news and the idiots like myself I suppose who consume it My last little point here is regarding Harrys ghostwriter He deserves a ton of credit This memoir is beautifully written and I thoroughly enjoyed all the little allusions to Dickens Wordsworth Shakespeare Steinbeck and his supposed favorite Faulkner regardless if he admits to getting the last from Brainy Quotes Its hilarious how Harry says straight up that he barely got out of Eton doesnt read literature isnt bookish at all then in the next breath discusses the Dickensian elements of British life and the craggy cliffs in the Lake District with allusions to Wordsworth Not that I read any of that tripe when I was in school he basically says in another breath Its his ghostwriters ectoplasm oozing between the lines That would be such an interesting job wouldnt it Taking peoples life stories and spinning them into a cohesive narrative Most people have no idea how to go about doing that themselves and I for one think that our actual storytellers in this case Pulitzer prize winner JR Moehringer really deserve the credit Storytellers narrative spinnersthey have the power they are the ones who shape reality or at least peoples perception of it And with that in mind Harry and Megs definitely won this round They wrestled their story away from the Paps and the tabloids and everyone else who is trying to use their story for their own purposes and decided to tell it their way Bold move That said they are still a bunch of entitled whiny brats and need to go awayShow more
Rating 5 out of 5,"Now THIS was a great way to usher in the first reads of 2023. Whilst I’m a born and raised Yank, my husband is a Brit who often chides me for my interest in the royals, insisting I care more about their exploits and experiences than the majority of those in the UK. I do find the entire monarchy to be a fascinating study in heritage and tradition. Though my initial interest was sparked by Princess Diana, it is Harry about whom I’ve become exceedingly curious—and this book fed my hunger to know more.The book begins with the death of Diana—a loss that shaped young Harry in ways that he could have never imagined the day he was forced to walk behind her casket as it was slowly moved through the streets and to her final resting place. Throughout the pages, Harry’s pain is evident as he speaks of his conviction, as a child, that his mother had simply chosen to disappear and would someday return. The pages bleed blue blood, and Harry is laid bare as a confused and emotionally neglected young boy. As an American, it is difficult for me to understand a young life devoid of any physical affection. As a Brit, my husband has struggled to convince me that this was just “the way of things”. Harry describes no hugging or physical contact of any kind from his father or his grandmother. For a child grieving, this struck me as particularly barbaric. Tradition or no, for me it brought tears.Harry goes on to expose his teen years, cutting his teeth under the constant watchful eye of the much hated paparazzi. His adolescent indulgences, indiscretions and mistakes all played out on the public stage, where, after each episode, he was shredded in print. The lies, embellishments and constant hounding of the media are shared in great detail, each adding to his disgust with the ugliness of the press and his growing frustration with the indifference of his family as to the damage being wrought. He glosses over a number of relationships cut short by an inability for those not used to the constant scrutiny to suddenly live like an insect under a microscope, and he rages about the seeming sense of entitlement photographers felt when wanting access to his private life. If they weren’t invited in, they barged in, snuck in, and waltzed in without a single thought as to how it was affecting Harry and his brother.There is what seemed to me to be precious little of the relationship between William and Harry, the heir and the spare (a phrase Harry heard from the time he was old enough to understand his place in the hierarchy), with the exception of the growing expanse between them. Harry shares a few anecdotes that paint William unfavorably, but he seems to skirt around the sibling rivalry that was unfolding. Perhaps he felt he was already pushing the envelope and feared reprisals, or maybe he just felt that he still had a familial obligation to protect William. In either case, both William and King Charles are certainly described as the stereotypic royal—self-absorbed and unwilling to break with tradition even if it meant sacrificing one of their own.Harry’s relationship with the three most important aspects of his life are revealed in great detail—his love of Africa, the British military and Meghan Markle. The excerpts revolving around his time in Botswana are some of the most beautiful in the book, and his revelations about Meghan’s near breakdown are the most heart wrenching. After reading, I was left with a profound dislike of Charles, Camilla and William, based mostly on their bending the rules only when it benefitted them personally, and insisting on tradition when it didn’t. I was also left lukewarm about Meghan and her sometimes brash attempts to fit into the life Harry opened to her. Overall, an expose of sorts that answered some questions and left me with many more. A five star read for anyone with an interest in the contemporary royal family.Show more",5,Now THIS was a great way to usher in the first reads of 2023 Whilst Im a born and raised Yank my husband is a Brit who often chides me for my interest in the royals insisting I care more about their exploits and experiences than the majority of those in the UK I do find the entire monarchy to be a fascinating study in heritage and tradition Though my initial interest was sparked by Princess Diana it is Harry about whom Ive become exceedingly curiousand this book fed my hunger to know moreThe book begins with the death of Dianaa loss that shaped young Harry in ways that he could have never imagined the day he was forced to walk behind her casket as it was slowly moved through the streets and to her final resting place Throughout the pages Harrys pain is evident as he speaks of his conviction as a child that his mother had simply chosen to disappear and would someday return The pages bleed blue blood and Harry is laid bare as a confused and emotionally neglected young boy As an American it is difficult for me to understand a young life devoid of any physical affection As a Brit my husband has struggled to convince me that this was just the way of things Harry describes no hugging or physical contact of any kind from his father or his grandmother For a child grieving this struck me as particularly barbaric Tradition or no for me it brought tearsHarry goes on to expose his teen years cutting his teeth under the constant watchful eye of the much hated paparazzi His adolescent indulgences indiscretions and mistakes all played out on the public stage where after each episode he was shredded in print The lies embellishments and constant hounding of the media are shared in great detail each adding to his disgust with the ugliness of the press and his growing frustration with the indifference of his family as to the damage being wrought He glosses over a number of relationships cut short by an inability for those not used to the constant scrutiny to suddenly live like an insect under a microscope and he rages about the seeming sense of entitlement photographers felt when wanting access to his private life If they werent invited in they barged in snuck in and waltzed in without a single thought as to how it was affecting Harry and his brotherThere is what seemed to me to be precious little of the relationship between William and Harry the heir and the spare a phrase Harry heard from the time he was old enough to understand his place in the hierarchy with the exception of the growing expanse between them Harry shares a few anecdotes that paint William unfavorably but he seems to skirt around the sibling rivalry that was unfolding Perhaps he felt he was already pushing the envelope and feared reprisals or maybe he just felt that he still had a familial obligation to protect William In either case both William and King Charles are certainly described as the stereotypic royalselfabsorbed and unwilling to break with tradition even if it meant sacrificing one of their ownHarrys relationship with the three most important aspects of his life are revealed in great detailhis love of Africa the British military and Meghan Markle The excerpts revolving around his time in Botswana are some of the most beautiful in the book and his revelations about Meghans near breakdown are the most heart wrenching After reading I was left with a profound dislike of Charles Camilla and William based mostly on their bending the rules only when it benefitted them personally and insisting on tradition when it didnt I was also left lukewarm about Meghan and her sometimes brash attempts to fit into the life Harry opened to her Overall an expose of sorts that answered some questions and left me with many more A five star read for anyone with an interest in the contemporary royal familyShow more
Rating 5 out of 5,"Ok buckle up kids. First of all, i listened to this on audible as i couldn’t resist hearing him read this himself. It felt so intimate and conversational. I’ve seen a few folks say that the book feels very stream of consciousness and honestly, when listening to him that did not bother me at all. As a therapist, i found myself gasping at moments around his experience of and reaction to trauma. And as much as i would have liked to give William a serious piece of my mind by the end, i realize that William never got the mental health help that Harry ultimately did. Or maybe because he was so dependent on the press machine, he is stuck living with a grueling cognitive dissonance that William hates / loves / needs them. There was a line that Harry attributes to Charles when they were talking after Prince Phillip’s death that says something like the vitriol of the press is hard to bear, but their love and adulation is worth the cost, and i think that is an incredibly honest reflection of the relationship of the royal family to the media. There is a symbiosis that Harry could never stomach after seeing what it did to Diana and how it destroyed the lives of anyone he let get close to him, but to the larger royal family, the death of the parasite (the media) means their death. Also, who had Camilla as the villain on their 2023 bingo card? The rehabilitation of her image must have been more effective than i was consciously aware of because I was horrified by how she - from Harry’s POV - used the media to prop herself up and tear down Diana’s boys and their wives. Charles also didn’t come out of this unscathed as I walked away feeling like he is also deeply traumatized and future king first, husband to Camilla second, father distant third. There were absolutely moments where Harry came across as completely unaware of his privilege, and while at first i found that kind of off-putting, how can the bird in the guided cage understand that not everyone lives the way they do. And Harry’s descriptions of his accommodations in the palace were not very flattering, as it seemed he was often shuffled off to a shabby bachelor pad. The saddest part of this for me was watching the deterioration of the relationship between the brothers. William does not ever come across as being particularly close or brotherly towards Harry, but they had a shared trauma and shared memories. As Harry became more well, this stopped being enough to hold them together and their relationship, poor as it was, seems to have truly fractured. Ultimately, there is a restraint to this that i both marvel at and appreciate. I have seen some royal watchers say that the press is furious about Spare because Harry scooped them. He talks about his drug use, his sex life, the infamous wearing of the Nazi uniform, his “togger” getting “frostnip,” his military time, his dating, his meeting “Meg,” their relationship, the birth of their children - all the skeletons are there and not glorified but not passed over either. There is no story. And anything the media runs with ultimately is more publicity for the book, which paints the media in an extremely negative light. Worth the read? Yes. Worth the listen?

Rating 3 out of 5,"Well, well, well. It has been a second since I finished a book. Just really took a little break there. But thanks to a giftcard from Rae like 2? 3? years ago, I finally made an Audible account and ""read"" something, anything. And with that, my Goodreads reviews are back for the fans, hope you enjoy.I think I am a respectable choice to review this book because I have been largely impartial between Team William and Team Harry. Maybe ""impartial"" is a bad word and ""wishy-washy"" is the better choice. I fluctuate based on who is giving the better narrative (aka if Harry and Meghan have made either a good point or a bad point in their recent interviews). And, of course, William and Kate get points for their silence despite the weighty narrative that Harry and Meg put forward.Here is my main problem with this book: Harry takes no personal responsibility for his life or relationships. Harry is completely a victim. And this is not cabined to how the royal family treats him and Meghan now, as you might expect--it permeates his whole life. It was a recurring theme: ""I did X with the best of intentions and these malignant forces/people ruined everything."" Prince Harry never admits ""you know what? I'm a little arrogant because of who I am. And sometimes that makes me hard to get along with."" It was more so, for example, ""I have always been such a lovely and encouraging brother to William and he is always so competitive with me and maybe actively seeks that I don't succeed in life and I don't understand why!!"" Even the title reflects that Harry is a bit resentful that he is a ""spare."" Why not just be like ""and, you know, maybe I have given William a hard time throughout his life because I resent that he is the future of the British monarchy.""And this makes this book feel very ghost-written. Were I to write a book like this about myself, I would hope that I would recognize how my own flaws contributed to a situation. Maybe Harry doesn't want to give the media any more fodder by admitting some of his flaws. But it would have been way more refreshing to have Harry be like ""here are the personality traits that I am bringing to the table that actively harmed this interaction"" instead of ""I was basically perfect and all of these meanies are ruining everything!"" Because, at the end of the day, it just means you're confronted with scenario after scenario that you can't really reason through. And when Meg enters the book, the same goes for her. Nary a bad word is spoken about Meg--and, to be fair, it makes sense to give only a rosy depiction of your wife--but it makes the recounting of events feel false. Even the bridesmaid dresses story--which, as an aside, was an incredibly dumb situation, especially considering the amount of time we as a society have spent discussing it. But Harry is like ""oh, you know, Kate called Meg about these dresses and Meg was obviously really stressed out about the wedding and Kate made her cry."" And it's like, by ""stressed about the wedding,"" do you mean Meg yelled at Kate first? Or raise her voice? Was it really apropos of nothing? Did Meg truly do absolutely nothing to escalate tensions at any point, ever?I could go on, but I'll stop there. I think that is this book's deep, fundamental flaw. I know Harry wants to tell his side of the story, but I think a more accurate telling would have made him less of a pure victim and more of a character.There are also some pacing issues. The book starts with Princess Diana's death and ends with Queen Elizabeth's death (in the Epilogue). And based on that description, you have likely mapped out how the book will progress, considering the points of interest for the general public. You're probably incorrect--we spend a ton of time on Harry's time at school and Harry's time in the military. I thought Harry's time at school was fine, but Harry's time in the military was really rough to get through. It's weird to hear someone talk at length about a generally dangerous job where they are kept pretty safe. Whatever the mission, Prince Harry isn't really doing the interesting stuff. So the progression of the book suffers. A lot of it involved flying a helicopter around. And also doing a ton of training to deploy for a few weeks before it got too dangerous again and they had to pull you out. To the book's credit, it (1) reveals more information than you would expect out of a royal, for better or for worse and (2) is a scathing indictment of the British media. I didn't read a ton of the reviews before I read this book, and was very surprised at some of the stuff we were learning. You could tell that some family members were being protected (the Queen gets only delightful anecdotes) and other family members are not being protected at all (William and Charles do not look cute here, Camilla is an evil stepmother). I think the inter-family dynamic information is far riskier than ""I put my mother's lotion *down there,*"" as I think the former is of far more modern-day relevance. There were other anecdotes like the ""lotion anecdote"" which almost seemed forced/applied to make the book sell more copies. Like, sure, he got frostbite. It went away. Who cares? This was also a scathing indictment of the British media, which is probably an appropriate reckoning for them, from what I've heard. So good on Harry for that.If you're morbidly curious about the royal family, this book reveals more than you would think about their inter-family dynamics. But be warned: Harry is playing defense and leaving little room for nuance. Harry (or his ghost-writer) is not prepared to acknowledge his responsibility in all of this, and it makes it hard to trust his depiction of events.Show more",3,Well well well It has been a second

Rating 5 out of 5,"I’m not a Royal Watcher and as an American, I don’t know a lot about the inner workings of the Royal Family. At two years Harry’s junior, I do remember MTV News breaking into their programming to announce Princess Diana’s accident and I stayed up with my sister to watch her funeral. I caught bits and pieces of William and Harry’s weddings and I have a natural disdain for King Charles. I don’t respect cheaters, even if they’re Royal. I also think the idea of royalty is antiquated and unnecessary; but I’m an American, so maybe I’m not meant to get it. Now that that is out of the way Spare gets ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️. Full disclosure I give all memoirs five stars because who am to judge someone else’s existence but Spare is so well written it would have gotten it regardless. Harry doesn’t hold back in Spare and his unfiltered truth was refreshing. It is very clear that the loss of his mother was very hard on him and the adults around him did a huge disservice by ignoring his emotional turmoil. I also felt a lot of heartbreak in the relationship he had with his brother versus what it is now. Did Harry come off as entitled? Yes. But anyone who grew up in royalty would, with that said, there is growth from his youth to where he is now. Is he still entitled? I image that is hard to break but he sounded relatable in a way I wouldn’t expect a Prince would. I didn’t watch Suits so I didn’t have much of an opinion about Meghan Markle and after hearing about their relationship having to google who she was. It is clear that Harry loves her and is terrified of her fate being the same as Princess Diana’s. Spare was not as jaw dropping as one would expect with the effort the British press is doing to dismiss it. Their culpability In the harassment of Harry and his family is spoken about at lengths. Seriously, the relationship with the media and the Royal family comes off as incestuous. It’s gross and icky. Also, and this is a little pot meets kettle, the British people need to accept that their media treated Meghan in radically insensitive ways and fix that. Coming from an American, I get how that sounds, but how they treated her and their children is not okay. The opposite of racism isn’t silence, it’s being anti-racist. Overall I thought it was well written and honest. Things I didn’t expect? Googling what happens to a woman’s nether region in the North Pole. If you’ve read the book, you get this. Women don’t need sweat so how do they cope with the moisture? My biggest take away, I am officially Team Harry. I’ve always hated King Charles but now I equally hate Prince William. What a sad sack of 💩 they both are.Show more",5,Im not a Royal Watcher and as an American I dont know a lot about the inner workings of the Royal Family At two years Harrys junior I do remember MTV News breaking into their programming to announce Princess Dianas accident and I stayed up with my sister to watch her funeral I caught bits and pieces of William and Harrys weddings and I have a natural disdain for King Charles I dont respect cheaters even if theyre Royal I also think the idea of royalty is antiquated and unnecessary but Im an American so maybe Im not meant to get it Now that that is out of the way Spare gets   Full disclosure I give all memoirs five stars because who am to judge someone elses existence but Spare is so well written it would have gotten it regardless Harry doesnt hold back in Spare and his unfiltered truth was refreshing It is very clear that the loss of his mother was very hard on him and the adults around him did a huge disservice by ignoring his emotional turmoil I also felt a lot of heartbreak in the relationship he had with his brother versus what it is now Did Harry come off as entitled Yes But anyone who grew up in royalty would with that said there is growth from his youth to where he is now Is he still entitled I image that is hard to break but he sounded relatable in a way I wouldnt expect a Prince would I didnt watch Suits so I didnt have much of an opinion about Meghan Markle and after hearing about their relationship having to google who she was It is clear that Harry loves her and is terrified of her fate being the same as Princess Dianas Spare was not as jaw dropping as one would expect with the effort the British press is doing to dismiss it Their culpability In the harassment of Harry and his family is spoken about at lengths Seriously the relationship with the media and the Royal family comes off as incestuous Its gross and icky Also and this is a little pot meets kettle the British people need to accept that their media treated Meghan in radically insensitive ways and fix that Coming from an American I get how that sounds but how they treated her and their children is not okay The opposite of racism isnt silence its being antiracist Overall I thought it was well written and honest Things I didnt expect Googling what happens to a womans nether region in the North Pole If youve read the book you get this Women dont need sweat so how do they cope with the moisture My biggest take away I am officially Team Harry Ive always hated King Charles but now I equally hate Prince William What a sad sack of  they both areShow more
Rating 3 out of 5,"I had a great week chatting with my book club girlies about this title. I had been in two minds to voice my opinion about my thoughts, as have a few other members, but then I thought, why not? For one thing, there have been many different feelings and points made on both sides of the table within our group, and we have all remained respectful and friends, so I think I should be able to do the same in my review, so here goes. If I had to sum up this book in a sentence, it would be we are all heroes of our narrative. Having previously read Revenge by Tom Bower, as I believed it to be the closest we will get to the other side of the story, I still chose to go in with an open mind. My overall feeling after finishing both books is sadness for all involved. Regardless of their titles and position, their family has been torn apart, leaving Harry estranged from his father, brother and many extended family and lifelong friends. That cannot be easy. What bothered me most was as much as Harry repeatedly claimed how happy he was, I couldn't help but I don't think anyone happy and content with their choices would write something so scathing and damaging to all involved. For me, the title of this book sums up his motivations and Harry as a person. It's now abundantly clear that his feelings of being repeatedly sidelined and unsupported by his family and the firm as a whole, together with his staggering resentment and frequent disagreements with his brother and heir, plagued him long before Meghan entered his life, and are the root of all the issues he is facing. Therefore to blame her for all of the events would be ridiculous. She was his get-out-of-jail card in many ways, providing support and validation, which allowed him to make the move he had been itching to make for years.Many parts read like a teenager having a massive tantrum. Also, I was not too fond of how he needlessly ridiculed a member of staff who worked at his school. I don't find any laughs at the expense of another person's disability or appearance amusing. He went some way to redeem, however, in frequent snippets of his kinder, playful sides, which was a welcome break from the heavier-going chapters. In the current climate, I found his many ungrateful references to his life of great wealth and privilege tone deaf. The fact Harry and Meghan seem to believe they can pick and choose the media they undertake seems naive and foolish. You cannot appear on Netflix on a Tuesday and then cry about being papped in Whole Foods on Friday.There has to be great empathy for Harry for losing his mother, but at almost forty, it is time to stop riding that wave, if only for his own sake, to give himself a chance to live in the present. Do I think he should take some responsibility for his part in the last few years? Absolutely. There becomes a point we all have to take accountability for our parts, and I think Harry is long overdue in this aspect. As the saying goes, there is no smoke without fire; however, the chances of either side flying the white flag after this, I would say, is improbable. I hope this all dies down soon, and they all find peace.Show more",3,I had a great week chatting with my book club girlies about this title I had been in two minds to voice my opinion about my thoughts as have a few other members but then I thought why not For one thing there have been many different feelings and points made on both sides of the table within our group and we have all remained respectful and friends so I think I should be able to do the same in my review so here goes If I had to sum up this book in a sentence it would be we are all heroes of our narrative Having previously read Revenge by Tom Bower as I believed it to be the closest we will get to the other side of the story I still chose to go in with an open mind My overall feeling after finishing both books is sadness for all involved Regardless of their titles and position their family has been torn apart leaving Harry estranged from his father brother and many extended family and lifelong friends That cannot be easy What bothered me most was as much as Harry repeatedly claimed how happy he was I couldnt help but I dont think anyone happy and content with their choices would write something so scathing and damaging to all involved For me the title of this book sums up his motivations and Harry as a person Its now abundantly clear that his feelings of being repeatedly sidelined and unsupported by his family and the firm as a whole together with his staggering resentment and frequent disagreements with his brother and heir plagued him long before Meghan entered his life and are the root of all the issues he is facing Therefore to blame her for all of the events would be ridiculous She was his getoutofjail card in many ways providing support and validation which allowed him to make the move he had been itching to make for yearsMany parts read like a teenager having a massive tantrum Also I was not too fond of how he needlessly ridiculed a member of staff who worked at his school I dont find any laughs at the expense of another persons disability or appearance amusing He went some way to redeem however in frequent snippets of his kinder playful sides which was a welcome break from the heaviergoing chapters In the current climate I found his many ungrateful references to his life of great wealth and privilege tone deaf The fact Harry and Meghan seem to believe they can pick and choose the media they undertake seems naive and foolish You cannot appear on Netflix on a Tuesday and then cry about being papped in Whole Foods on FridayThere has to be great empathy for Harry for losing his mother but at almost forty it is time to stop riding that wave if only for his own sake to give himself a chance to live in the present Do I think he should take some responsibility for his part in the last few years Absolutely There becomes a point we all have to take accountability for our parts and I think Harry is long overdue in this aspect As the saying goes there is no smoke without fire however the chances of either side flying the white flag after this I would say is improbable I hope this all dies down soon and they all find peaceShow more
Rating 4 out of 5,"I would like to begin by saying that I have always been supporters of Harry and Meghan in that I don’t care that they “left” the Royal family. It is 100% their prerogative to live the life they want, and to do what they believe is best for their family. I do not think privilege or being born into a famous family gives the world the right to all of the sordid details of your life - particularly without your consent or through harassment. I also don’t think you have an obligation to stay or keep your children in a toxic situation. If they had been “average” people, we would have applauded them for caring for themselves, but since they are celebrities and part of the Royal Family they should suck it up because “that’s the way it is”? Huh? Now that I got that out of the way... I really enjoyed this. Harry is an excellent narrator and I think he should read more audiobooks! There were times when he was speaking about his mother that it was quite emotional - I teared up a few times and also about what it was like being a kid in that system.There were times that it felt a bit whiny, although he doesn’t acknowledge his privilege throughout. There was this running theme that implied William was jealous that got a bit overplayed and annoying for me. The parts that I enjoyed the most were the little tidbits about different members of the family that gave a tiny insight into what life was like. Or fleeting memories of long dead persons, like Princess Margaret, the Queen Mother, or the Queen herself. I also enjoyed hearing him talk about his time in the military and in Botswana. He is clearly really passionate about both of those things. If you came for the “drama” it is certainly there. He addresses every controversy that he has ever made headlines for it felt like, and also the falling out with his brother and Charles. If anyone took heat in the book, it was the two of them, although I would say it wasn’t as harsh as I thought it was going to be. Anyway, those were my first thoughts and takeaways!

Rating 2 out of 5,"I just don’t know how to rate this. Reading it does remind me to have sympathy for him for the tragic things he has gone through in his life, chiefly losing his mother in such a traumatic and public way at a young age. He clearly still has a lot of issues stemming from that event that should be addressed in therapy, and the dysfunction in his family is very clear. However, the memoir read overall like a personal list of grievances with the press and family members, with very little acknowledgment of the tremendous privilege he has, and there is absolutely no self awareness that he or his wife could have had a part to play in anything negative (and did we really need that much detail on the frosty todger, so unnecessary).The actual exit from the Royal Family is glossed over and he never explains why (as surely was explained to him) their original proposal did not work. We get tremendous detail on seemingly inconsequential items and the big question he seems to promise to answer - why he left - is not well answered in my opinion. He wants the advantages and privileges that come with being part of his family (advantages and privileges paid for with public funds, taxpayer funds) without any of the baggage and difficulty that being in the public eye brings. To separate from that, but still complain when your funding and your security are pulled (because you are no longer doing the job that entitled you to it) doesn’t sit well. I do think the Palace should have broken with tradition and issued a statement strongly condemning the awful racist things that were being written about Meghan at the beginning of their relationship, but there would never be issuing of statement after statement for every single negative story written, as Harry seemed to want them to do. The section on his time in the military was the best part, and showed him at his best as well. I highly recommend reading The Palace Papers by Tina Brown for a more balanced view of the ins and outs of the Royal Family, and a good look at the history that contributes to the decision to not allow Harry and Meghan (or anyone else) to be part time working Royals.Show more",2,I just dont know how to rate this Reading it does remind me to have sympathy for him for the tragic things he has gone through in his life chiefly losing his mother in such a traumatic and public way at a young age He clearly still has a lot of issues stemming from that event that should be addressed in therapy and the dysfunction in his family is very clear However the memoir read overall like a personal list of grievances with the press and family members with very little acknowledgment of the tremendous privilege he has and there is absolutely no self awareness that he or his wife could have had a part to play in anything negative and did we really need that much detail on the frosty todger so unnecessaryThe actual exit from the Royal Family is glossed over and he never explains why as surely was explained to him their original proposal did not work We get tremendous detail on seemingly inconsequential items and the big question he seems to promise to answer  why he left  is not well answered in my opinion He wants the advantages and privileges that come with being part of his family advantages and privileges paid for with public funds taxpayer funds without any of the baggage and difficulty that being in the public eye brings To separate from that but still complain when your funding and your security are pulled because you are no longer doing the job that entitled you to it doesnt sit well I do think the Palace should have broken with tradition and issued a statement strongly condemning the awful racist things that were being written about Meghan at the beginning of their relationship but there would never be issuing of statement after statement for every single negative story written as Harry seemed to want them to do The section on his time in the military was the best part and showed him at his best as well I highly recommend reading The Palace Papers by Tina Brown for a more balanced view of the ins and outs of the Royal Family and a good look at the history that contributes to the decision to not allow Harry and Meghan or anyone else to be part time working RoyalsShow more
Rating 4 out of 5,"Prince Harry provides an intimate look at his life through personal stories from his childhood, about his mum, life as a Royal, his military career, his charitable work and of course Meghan. Harry comes across as genuine, open and honest throughout. The family dysfunction is relatable, and he addresses his own mistakes. The writing is funny at times and provides clarity and context to many previously heard stories. His great love and respect for his grandfather and his tender memories of his grandmother are heartwarming. It is clear he suffers from the trauma of his mother’s death and is still living under this shadow. His biggest complaint is his family’s failure to act on his and his wife’s behalf to protect them from the media. Their silence and ‘just ignore it’ attitude are what led to Harry and Meghan leaving the royal family. One sentence struck me as profoundly sad. Harry states,” he prefers the battlefield of war to palace life as in battle there are clear rules of engagement and honor.” Harry certainly grew up in privilege but that does not make him unworthy of empathy. An excellent read for anyone interested in a behind the scenes story on Prince Harry’s life so far. Of note, Harry has donated $1,500,000 from proceeds of this book to support children in Botswana impacted by AIDs. He has also donated 300,000 GBP to Well Child, a British non-profit supporting sick children at home.Note: This book contains sibling rivalry, trauma and dysfunctional families.For more royal family stories, The Palace Papers by Tina Brown has added depth and nuance to royal family events.

Rating 4 out of 5,"Spare is a fascinating glimpse into a terribly unique life. Sure, all lives are unique. But few are quite this exacting. Some thoughts, in no particular order.-Harry is a shockingly good narrator. Like, I legitimately think he should continue to narrate audiobooks. -I think a well-established white guy talking about his emotional health and therapy and the fallibility of memory and family dynamics is an above all good thing. I don't think everyone will view it that way, but I do.-The Diana stuff gutted me. Her death was one of the first major world events I can recall. (If you haven't listed to the You're Wrong About series they did on her, I highly recommend it.)-Clearly after her death, Harry turned away from the system that wasn't supporting him as the spare and William turned towards the system that was supporting him as the heir. To me, it all comes down to that.-I was surprised by how much I ended up liking Charles in this portrayal? I certainly don't agree with a lot of what he's done, but this did make me realize that the press has hugely impacted his life, too.-The ghostwriter did a good job. Sometimes the metaphors are a little heavy-handed and the chapters are a titch too short (although it does keep things moving) but on the whole, the writing was solid and sounded like Harry. Listening to the audiobook convinced me of that. -I'll be honest and say that I skipped a good chunk of Part Two. I don't care as much about the military stuff, even though I do think it meant a lot to him. I plan to go back and skim through it once my hardcover hold shows up. -The British press really is brutal. I knew that and there were not many surprises for me in Part Three with Meghan, but some of the press's coverage of Harry's teen and early life shocked me.-Harry adores his wife and kids. That's always been evident and is very clear here.-As you've probably heard, the book does get into Harry talking about the racism inherent and transparent in the monarchy (and obviously the press), but it does leave a lot to be desired on the future of monarchy and the history of colonialism. But I think a lot of that is still being sorted out for Harry. -The ending is a tad abrupt. Would love a follow up story in ten years. -I'm positive we'll get a Meghan memoir at some point. -Honestly, good for them for telling their side of the story. Nothing ever changes under the infamous ""Never complain, never explain"" royal standard.Show more",4,Spare is a fascinating glimpse into a terribly unique life Sure all lives are unique But few are quite this exacting Some thoughts in no particular orderHarry is a shockingly good narrator Like I legitimately think he should continue to narrate audiobooks I think a wellestablished white guy talking about his emotional health and therapy and the fallibility of memory and family dynamics is an above all good thing I dont think everyone will view it that way but I doThe Diana stuff gutted me Her death was one of the first major world events I can recall If you havent listed to the Youre Wrong About series they did on her I highly recommend itClearly after her death Harry turned away from the system that wasnt supporting him as the spare and William turned towards the system that was supporting him as the heir To me it all comes down to thatI was surprised by how much I ended up liking Charles in this portrayal I certainly dont agree with a lot of what hes done but this did make me realize that the press has hugely impacted his life tooThe ghostwriter did a good job Sometimes the metaphors are a little heavyhanded and the chapters are a titch too short although it does keep things moving but on the whole the writing was solid and sounded like Harry Listening to the audiobook convinced me of that Ill be honest and say that I skipped a good chunk of Part Two I dont care as much about the military stuff even though I do think it meant a lot to him I plan to go back and skim through it once my hardcover hold shows up The British press really is brutal I knew that and there were not many surprises for me in Part Three with Meghan but some of the presss coverage of Harrys teen and early life shocked meHarry adores his wife and kids Thats always been evident and is very clear hereAs youve probably heard the book does get into Harry talking about the racism inherent and transparent in the monarchy and obviously the press but it does leave a lot to be desired on the future of monarchy and the history of colonialism But I think a lot of that is still being sorted out for Harry The ending is a tad abrupt Would love a follow up story in ten years Im positive well get a Meghan memoir at some point Honestly good for them for telling their side of the story Nothing ever changes under the infamous Never complain never explain royal standardShow more
Rating 3 out of 5,"It's rather frustrating to see people's personal opinions and political arguments bleeding into the reviews here as though this is a reddit thread rather than a platform for reviewing the literature itself. That being said, I just finished the audiobook which I listened to during commute and work over the last 2 days because I wanted the full context behind the clips and snippets that keep getting extracted and batted around in the media.Regarding the experience as a whole I've gone for a bland middle of the road rating because I feel that a lot of this book could have been edited back. I think if I'd have been reading instead of listening I might have given up at points. There were interesting stories about his upbringing, relationship with the King and his older relatives. That's a take that is unique and nice to see from the horse's mouth rather than royal biographers or Netflix produced drama. There were also a lot of stories peppered in that probably didn't need to be - they don't reveal much about Harry as a man or add to the overall narrative about the press that is underpinning the book. I'm aware that there was a ghostwriter on this project and I'm not personally keen on how flowery his language can be at times; I think it might have felt more authentic to get Harry truly in his own words, as you can tell from listening to him in interviews that he's not exactly inarticulate. Part of me wonders if I had just seen this as words on the page rather than hearing him speak if it would have felt like him writing his own story.Also to give him his due, he acknowledges contentious issues about the monarchy such as its imperialist and colonialist roots and I do think he is very switched onto this issue because it's a massive argument for abolitionism. It's not a black and white picture of the RF but a more nuanced picture in fuzzy grey, and I'll give credit to that.Regardless of my opinions on this man, his wife, his extended family or the institution it represents, I'd say it was a pretty average autobiography.

Rating 5 out of 5,"4.5 stars I’m so glad I chose the audiobook version of Spare! Hearing Harry tell his story was powerful. Spare is beautifully written (thanks to an excellent ghost writer) and meticulously crafted to draw the reader/listener in. The short chapters were nice in that they made it easy to pause and not get lost in the middle of a sprawling story. They were a bit annoying because I felt like the break/chapter announcement time added more length to an already lengthy book. I have always been curious about and have followed the British royal family. My grandmother used to play tea party with my sister and me - she was the Queen Mother, I was Diana, and Cathryn was Fergie. Those tea parties laid a foundation of fondness for the Windsors. I vividly remember my college roommate waking me early one morning to watch the live coverage of Princess Diana’s accident. We wept together sitting in her bed. I watched the weddings of both princes, the Queen’s Jubilee, her funeral, etc. so I feel invested in their paths. Spare is funny, heartbreaking, and cringey at times. Harry’s hatred for the press (especially paparazzi) is clear from the beginning. His ongoing pain from the death of his mother is palpable. His frustration with “The Firm” is understandable. He does discuss his peen a bit much for my liking. Ha. His romance with Megan and the births of their children were particularly lovely. The pain they endured at the hands of the press and the silence of the palace was difficult to hear laid bare. As was the sibling rivalry between Will and Harry, Camilla’s alleged scheming, and Charles’ complicity. I’m sure that parts of his story are unbalanced because this memoir is from his perspective. Harry does a fair bit of defending and positioning, and sometimes that left me feeling a little skeptical, but I do feel like it’s a worthwhile read/listen (definitely listen!!) if you are at all intrigued by the royal family.Show more",5,45 stars Im so glad I chose the audiobook version of Spare Hearing Harry tell his story was powerful Spare is beautifully written thanks to an excellent ghost writer and meticulously crafted to draw the readerlistener in The short chapters were nice in that they made it easy to pause and not get lost in the middle of a sprawling story They were a bit annoying because I felt like the breakchapter announcement time added more length to an already lengthy book I have always been curious about and have followed the British royal family My grandmother used to play tea party with my sister and me  she was the Queen Mother I was Diana and Cathryn was Fergie Those tea parties laid a foundation of fondness for the Windsors I vividly remember my college roommate waking me early one morning to watch the live coverage of Princess Dianas accident We wept together sitting in her bed I watched the weddings of both princes the Queens Jubilee her funeral etc so I feel invested in their paths Spare is funny heartbreaking and cringey at times Harrys hatred for the press especially paparazzi is clear from the beginning His ongoing pain from the death of his mother is palpable His frustration with The Firm is understandable He does discuss his peen a bit much for my liking Ha His romance with Megan and the births of their children were particularly lovely The pain they endured at the hands of the press and the silence of the palace was difficult to hear laid bare As was the sibling rivalry between Will and Harry Camillas alleged scheming and Charles complicity Im sure that parts of his story are unbalanced because this memoir is from his perspective Harry does a fair bit of defending and positioning and sometimes that left me feeling a little skeptical but I do feel like its a worthwhile readlisten definitely listen if you are at all intrigued by the royal familyShow more
Rating 3 out of 5,"Prince Harry's perspective on the challenges of royal life and why he decided to step away from full time royal duties and start a new life in North America. There are some really compelling chapters about Prince Harry's struggle to make sense of the death of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, the transformative impact of military service on his sense of self and his love of Botswana, Lesotho and South Africa. Prince Harry makes clear at the beginning of the book, however, that he has difficulties remembering past events and has little aptitude for, or interest in, royal history. The royal history woven into the narrative is often incorrect or oversimplified (for example, Prince Harry is not a descendant of Henry VI) and some of Harry's memories are contradicted by other sources (for example, where he was at the time of the Queen Mother's death). While Harry has some compelling objections to the behaviour of certain media outlets and their intrusive behaviour toward members of the royal family and people close to them, too much of the book is taken up by family conflict including comparatively minor conflicts concerning wedding planning. While Harry provides some touching anecdotes about his father, King Charles III, it's clear that he has always had a complicated relationship with his brother Prince William and the brothers come to resent each other for a variety of reasons. The book is well written and keeps the pages turning but the final chapters contain a lot of very familiar material because Harry and Meghan has spoken so often about their differences with the press and royal family in recent years. The audiobook is well read by the author.Show more",3,Prince Harrys perspective on the challenges of royal life and why he decided to step away from full time royal duties and start a new life in North America There are some really compelling chapters about Prince Harrys struggle to make sense of the death of his mother Diana Princess of Wales the transformative impact of military service on his sense of self and his love of Botswana Lesotho and South Africa Prince Harry makes clear at the beginning of the book however that he has difficulties remembering past events and has little aptitude for or interest in royal history The royal history woven into the narrative is often incorrect or oversimplified for example Prince Harry is not a descendant of Henry VI and some of Harrys memories are contradicted by other sources for example where he was at the time of the Queen Mothers death While Harry has some compelling objections to the behaviour of certain media outlets and their intrusive behaviour toward members of the royal family and people close to them too much of the book is taken up by family conflict including comparatively minor conflicts concerning wedding planning While Harry provides some touching anecdotes about his father King Charles III its clear that he has always had a complicated relationship with his brother Prince William and the brothers come to resent each other for a variety of reasons The book is well written and keeps the pages turning but the final chapters contain a lot of very familiar material because Harry and Meghan has spoken so often about their differences with the press and royal family in recent years The audiobook is well read by the authorShow more

Rating 4 out of 5,"Overarching opinion: if you dislike Harry, you won’t like this book. If you like Harry, or dislike the monarchy, there might be something for you in this book.I personally, have always liked and held a soft spot for Harry because we both lost parents at a young age. I’ve always been a removed royal watcher (AKA, I enjoyed the weddings and fashion, but generally didn’t pay attention to the rest). What really got my eyes on the family was Meghan joining the family, the bad press surrounding that, and their ultimate departure from the institution (which I fully support). So with all of my biases properly addressed: I really quite enjoyed this book. It chipped away at the mask the institution hides behind, it shows so much inner turmoil and work that H has been going through, it shows how much he loves and cares for his new family. There were a few moments it dragged on for me (mostly the military part), but I can acknowledge that was a major part of his life and a place where he finally felt normal regardless of how I feel about wars. I think the “bombshell headlines” that came out before I finished reading this only made me like it more, and make me a staunch Harry supporter? Like all of the weird press about his frostnipped penis made me take the context cues even more into consideration, and I think it was a bit of British humour to use as levity during that section of the book. Anyway, I’m rambling now. But main point is: just ignore it and stop posting one-star reviews just because you’re pro-Willy, or anti-monarch.

Rating 3 out of 5,"The book is divided into 3 parts, all of which feel deserving of their own rating. Part 1 - 3/5 Part 2 - 1/5Part 3 - 4/5All in all a decent read, well written enough to captivate (shout out to the ghost writer, great work) if you’re a royal family fanatic. Beyond that, maybe pass on this unless you’re interested in 400 pages of excruciatingly boring musings of the privileged and entitled, all wrapped in a complete lack of self awareness. This man needs more therapy, not a ghost writer or a pen. There just simply comes a point where you find yourself reading about the literal prince of the commonwealth sprinting up to a minimum wage supermarket employee demanding to know why the shelves have been rearranged and if they know if they “can even do that by law” that you have to just stop and wonder - is this guy for real? Which is the overwhelming sentiment of the book. I sympathize with Meghan more than I did when I started, and respect their love story and eventual departure more than I did. In that, his goal was met. Part 3 of this book could have been fleshed out to being the entire novel, which would have changed the amount of times I sat debating closing the book without finishing. However, the first two parts read as a spoiled brat’s petty vendetta against every single headline or rumour that has ever dared to swirl about him.Show more",3,The book is divided into 3 parts all of which feel deserving of their own rating Part 1  35 Part 2  15Part 3  45All in all a decent read well written enough to captivate shout out to the ghost writer great work if youre a royal family fanatic Beyond that maybe pass on this unless youre interested in 400 pages of excruciatingly boring musings of the privileged and entitled all wrapped in a complete lack of self awareness This man needs more therapy not a ghost writer or a pen There just simply comes a point where you find yourself reading about the literal prince of the commonwealth sprinting up to a minimum wage supermarket employee demanding to know why the shelves have been rearranged and if they know if they can even do that by law that you have to just stop and wonder  is this guy for real Which is the overwhelming sentiment of the book I sympathize with Meghan more than I did when I started and respect their love story and eventual departure more than I did In that his goal was met Part 3 of this book could have been fleshed out to being the entire novel which would have changed the amount of times I sat debating closing the book without finishing However the first two parts read as a spoiled brats petty vendetta against every single headline or rumour that has ever dared to swirl about himShow more
Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5ish ⭐️ This book is extremely long, so there is a lot to say. Generally, I like Prince Harry and think he is a decent human, but he is deeply out of touch. He has lived a life that has been sad and challenging, but its impossible to relate to him in many ways. So many points he made though out sharing his story were just completely lost unto me that it was almost funny - but hey, I guess billionaires are people too!!! The book is written in three sections; 1. His childhood (generally good) 2. His young adult life (before Meghan) (generally bad) 3. His life with Meghan and his fall out with the Royal Family (generally good). The book went from interesting to boring to interesting. His childhood was tragic. His young adulthood was focused on his military service and continuous travels to Africa. His life with Meghan is full of love from her but abandonment by his family. Some general notes: Meghan has done nothing wrong. The Royal Family does really suck - they would rather say nothing at all then offer support for their family, they stand for nothing and only care for themselves. Harry is likable for the most part but impossible for a normal person to relate to. Harry really does value his family / their opinions and the fact that that is not reciprocated is unfortunate. Nobody’s life is interesting enough that it needs to be explained for 15.5 hours. Harry reads the audiobook which is good. I read somewhere that he cut almost half of the book?? Don’t know what else he could talk about! I am glad I read it mostly because I am fueled by the drama of other peoples lives but probably wouldn’t read again - would suggest to people who have interest in knowing more about Harry / Meghan. I would say that it did change my thoughts about the situation in favor of H & M.

Rating 5 out of 5,"I absolutely loved it. Based on some of these reviews, it appears that some people are treating this as a history book and not a memoir meant to recount events from Harry’s perspective. I am certainly not naive to the fact that this is a one sided story or that it is clearly written by a ghost writer (which is not news to anyone.) Also giving a huge eye roll to the people giving low ball reviews who never even read the book. I think the stories in this book are raw and honest. I completely disagree with the comments that he took no ownership and only painted himself in a good light. He was very transparent about several things that certainly do the opposite, and I am happy this wasn’t just another memoir full of self-bragging. He writes of his privilege and certainly does not come off tone deaf to that. But to his point, privilege, money, and fancy titles don’t always equal happiness. I have so many thoughts, but in summary, I really enjoyed the intimate and vulnerable stories and honest self reflections in his memoir. I think in particular, his navigating through grief from losing his mother, then later his family and country, was powerful and moving. He deserved to put his thoughts and feelings down on paper, and I am certainly glad he did.

Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 stars.I really wanted to love this. I have a lot of sympathy for Prince Harry and this book gives a really interesting insight to the monarchy and its relationship with the press. Despite his royal status, Harry comes across as relatable and vulnerable. There are lots of heartfelt memories of his childhood, his time in the army, his battles with anxiety, and his yearning for a closer relationship with his brother.Less heartwarming is Harry’s apparent inability to see the world from the perspective of others. With throwaway descriptors of ‘dodgy girls’ (whatever that means) and pleas that he’s not racist after the press reported him using a racial slur (with very little unpacking of the biases he does have), his opinions often lack nuance and emotional maturity. He also does little to reckon with the enormity of his privilege and how this has shaped him.The central message of the book is clear: the press is awful, and growing in the spotlight as he did is akin to abuse. It makes complete sense why somebody in his position would want to leave the country. I'm glad that Harry's story has been told, but I feel that with more time and introspection, this could have been a much more compelling read.Show more",3,35 starsI really wanted to love this I have a lot of sympathy for Prince Harry and this book gives a really interesting insight to the monarchy and its relationship with the press Despite his royal status Harry comes across as relatable and vulnerable There are lots of heartfelt memories of his childhood his time in the army his battles with anxiety and his yearning for a closer relationship with his brotherLess heartwarming is Harrys apparent inability to see the world from the perspective of others With throwaway descriptors of dodgy girls whatever that means and pleas that hes not racist after the press reported him using a racial slur with very little unpacking of the biases he does have his opinions often lack nuance and emotional maturity He also does little to reckon with the enormity of his privilege and how this has shaped himThe central message of the book is clear the press is awful and growing in the spotlight as he did is akin to abuse It makes complete sense why somebody in his position would want to leave the country Im glad that Harrys story has been told but I feel that with more time and introspection this could have been a much more compelling readShow more
Rating 5 out of 5,"Wow. Where do I even begin with this one? This is a captivating and moving story of Prince Harry’s life living in the spotlight. I’m sickened by the actions of his family members. Yeah sure they’re part of an “establishment” but at the end of the day, they are family. Learning his own father and brother traded stories with the media to ensure no bad press came out about them is just UGH! They had no regard for the “spare.” As long as they saved themselves. I feel Harry put his entire soul into this book and it shows throughout. There are so many personal stories he shares that range in emotions from happy to heartbreaking. Dealing with the death of his mother at such a young age, to a frost bitten private part are just a taste of what’s in this book. I liked the audio version, as it’s read by Harry himself. The only complaint I have is the way he explains the same event by using three different ways of saying the same thing. It sounded overdone and a little exaggerated and was a little annoying. I recommend. It’s a great listen and a heart-breaking story. Now married and a father himself - Harry has dealt with his life the best he can. I think we’ll continue to see the fallout from him and Meghan walking away from their titles. Or pushed out rather. I’ve never liked his father - how he treated Princess Di is repulsive. He knew she was suffering and didn’t care. But how he treated his own sons is even more repulsive.

Rating 4 out of 5,"“A heir and a spare…” Personal review : ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ What a wild ride. Get ready for Harry to mention his private parts - so very often! 😂 filled with juicy tea on the alleged assault, King Charles and Camilla, Diana and her ghost, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, relationship drama, swoony Megan Markle love story, the papps (paparazzi) and drugs, so, so many drugs! I am so glad I read this book, although it was quite pricey, but after Harry abdicated the throne, guess he has to cut his loses somewhere. Honestly, I loved Harry’s perspective of being infantilized by the monarchy, creating such dependent creatures of royals- his constant love and support of his Granny throughout the novel was sweet. Harold, Haz, Harry was an easy character to connect with, I loved how the book was broken down into three easy to digest parts- his early life, finding a partner and himself, then life as a married family man. His autobiography did a great job of making him seem down to earth, as down to earth that a royal can be. I’m self obsessed with the royal family and all things HRH, thanks mom, and very much enjoyed learning a bit more about the resident “naughty prince” and his perspective of growing and glowing as a member of the monarchy. His mentions of Diana and connecting everything back to his love of his mummy left me heartbroken. I have always been a “team Willy” person, but after this memoir, I feel that both sides of this need some intense therapy! If you haven’t checked this one out yet, and you love the monarchy, do it! Synopsis: It was one of the most searing images of the twentieth century: two young boys, two princes, walking behind their mother’s coffin as the world watched in sorrow—and horror. As Princess Diana was laid to rest, billions wondered what Prince William and Prince Harry must be thinking and feeling—and how their lives would play out from that point on. For Harry, this is that story at last.Show more",4,A heir and a spare Personal review   What a wild ride Get ready for Harry to mention his private parts  so very often  filled with juicy tea on the alleged assault King Charles and Camilla Diana and her ghost the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge relationship drama swoony Megan Markle love story the papps paparazzi and drugs so so many drugs I am so glad I read this book although it was quite pricey but after Harry abdicated the throne guess he has to cut his loses somewhere Honestly I loved Harrys perspective of being infantilized by the monarchy creating such dependent creatures of royals his constant love and support of his Granny throughout the novel was sweet Harold Haz Harry was an easy character to connect with I loved how the book was broken down into three easy to digest parts his early life finding a partner and himself then life as a married family man His autobiography did a great job of making him seem down to earth as down to earth that a royal can be Im self obsessed with the royal family and all things HRH thanks mom and very much enjoyed learning a bit more about the resident naughty prince and his perspective of growing and glowing as a member of the monarchy His mentions of Diana and connecting everything back to his love of his mummy left me heartbroken I have always been a team Willy person but after this memoir I feel that both sides of this need some intense therapy If you havent checked this one out yet and you love the monarchy do it Synopsis It was one of the most searing images of the twentieth century two young boys two princes walking behind their mothers coffin as the world watched in sorrowand horror As Princess Diana was laid to rest billions wondered what Prince William and Prince Harry must be thinking and feelingand how their lives would play out from that point on For Harry this is that story at lastShow more
Rating 4 out of 5,"This was an insightful look inside the royal family & of course, Harry's life & perspective. I enjoyed reading the beautiful descriptions on the palace landscapes and views & descriptions on all of the historical rooms with their majestic furnishings and ambiance. I felt it was very endearing how Harry defended his wife & protected his family. The British press is something else! Very ruthless & cut throat! There were funny moments in the book too, like Harry describing Willys increasing baldness. I couldn't help but giggle when I read it put that way. It is utterly heartbreaking though, how Harry & Willy are now not close & barely talk. I thought this was the saddest thing of all, reading how further & further these two become over the last several years. I did find Charles' nickname of Darling boy to Harry, to be endearing. Whether Harry's time lines and stories here were spot on, only he knows. One thing I will say is that his feelings are his own & he is entitled to feel the way he feels no matter what anyone thinks or wants to believe. This was his truth and I applaud him for his braveness in protecting his family. I hope for him that one day his extended family will reach out to him more and not continue to see him as just a spare.Show more",4,This was an insightful look inside the royal family  of course Harrys life  perspective I enjoyed reading the beautiful descriptions on the palace landscapes and views  descriptions on all of the historical rooms with their majestic furnishings and ambiance I felt it was very endearing how Harry defended his wife  protected his family The British press is something else Very ruthless  cut throat There were funny moments in the book too like Harry describing Willys increasing baldness I couldnt help but giggle when I read it put that way It is utterly heartbreaking though how Harry  Willy are now not close  barely talk I thought this was the saddest thing of all reading how further  further these two become over the last several years I did find Charles nickname of Darling boy to Harry to be endearing Whether Harrys time lines and stories here were spot on only he knows One thing I will say is that his feelings are his own  he is entitled to feel the way he feels no matter what anyone thinks or wants to believe This was his truth and I applaud him for his braveness in protecting his family I hope for him that one day his extended family will reach out to him more and not continue to see him as just a spareShow more
Rating 4 out of 5,"I don’t know how much was Harry writing this or how much a ghost writer helped and I don’t know how much is accurately reflecting Harry’s thoughts and feelings and events during certain time periods or how much was dramatized for effect….either way, whoever did most of the writing, it was compelling and interesting and I think filled the main point of the book, which was to show the world Harry’s perspective on his childhood, adolescence, and adulthood before leaving the family (though he conveniently left out the part where he kinda came back?). Some of the passages about his military career I thought were really good and important for a lot of military personnel to read (everyone struggles with some sort of PTSD even if they never saw horrific combat like what’s portrayed and glorified in movies) but since it’s a prince writing about his life, I doubt many would.

Rating 5 out of 5,"OKAY, now that I’ve slept on it….1. I don’t find it comfortable to give people’s own accounts of their own lives ratings, but I’m giving this five to offset all the one-star trolls who didn’t even read it.2. If you’re just reading the headlines, then you’re not getting it. Harry’s got a strong narrative voice and it’s full of his trademark dry British humor. Plucking individual things out of it is a great way to get the wrong idea.3. I hope I’m alive to see the historical ripple effect from this book. 4. I do not agree that Harry is in any way putting his family “on blast.” He describes specific interactions and how they made him feel and/or how they contributed to his personal growth. If his family comes across as toxic in those interactions, it’s on them for being toxic, not on Harry for talking about it.5. I wish more people would go to therapy and unpack their generational trauma. And I can’t help but think that maybe that’s why so many people are so angry about this book. Because he has the courage to say the things they’re not willing to process about their own lives and people they may have on pedestals. If you don’t care about the royals at all, I doubt that reading this would suddenly make you interested. But if you’ve followed them in any way or watched any episodes of The Crown, I think reading this book is an important and highly historically relevant exercise.Show more",5,OKAY now that Ive slept on it1 I dont find it comfortable to give peoples own accounts of their own lives ratings but Im giving this five to offset all the onestar trolls who didnt even read it2 If youre just reading the headlines then youre not getting it Harrys got a strong narrative voice and its full of his trademark dry British humor Plucking individual things out of it is a great way to get the wrong idea3 I hope Im alive to see the historical ripple effect from this book 4 I do not agree that Harry is in any way putting his family on blast He describes specific interactions and how they made him feel andor how they contributed to his personal growth If his family comes across as toxic in those interactions its on them for being toxic not on Harry for talking about it5 I wish more people would go to therapy and unpack their generational trauma And I cant help but think that maybe thats why so many people are so angry about this book Because he has the courage to say the things theyre not willing to process about their own lives and people they may have on pedestals If you dont care about the royals at all I doubt that reading this would suddenly make you interested But if youve followed them in any way or watched any episodes of The Crown I think reading this book is an important and highly historically relevant exerciseShow more
Rating 5 out of 5,"Wow. Okay. The other day, I saw a perfect comparison about this book and Eminem's movie, 8 Mile. The Tiktok creator explained that in the rap battle, Marshall Mathers got ahead of the narrative and rapped about all his failures and everything that his competitor will and could potentially roast him for. They said that it's exactly what Harry did in this book. He beat the British media, and essentially, the Royals to the punch and show the world exactly what they've been accusing them for. I felt like this was his Hail Mary pass, the corner in which they were backed into. Done with the lies, done with British tabloids and press assigning motives to the Sussex'. It is, in all honesty, Harry's attempt to take back his humanity and personhood while declaring independence from the throne. Divided in three parts, Harry's memoir is part story-telling, part rant, and part a love letter. A love letter to his mum, a love letter to his country, and a love letter to Meg. Besides the fact that it's a juicy account of what went behind closed doors at Buckingham, the candor and the unintentional humour made this 400-some-page book a one-sitting read. In some ways, I couldn't help but felt sympathy for the poor little prince. It took him awhile to get over his mum's passing. For months, the young teen kept telling himself that his mum didn't die but temporarily went away because she couldn't deal with the pressures of being a royal. He didn't cry when she died. Over the years, and one heartbreak after another, Harry's life was ruled by the dictates of royalty and how the tabloids portrayed him to be. He's not perfect by any stretch. He made faux pas that got him crucified in the press but life isn't fair and people's memories are short. Harry was such a romantic at heart and wanted to fall in love and start a family at a young age. But every single woman that he fell in love with couldn't handle being the target of scrutiny and unending torment by the paparazzi and the press. They were relentless. So when he met and fell in love with an American actress, he was doubly worried. Of course, he didn't know the extent of how the tabloids will treat Meghan. Not only she was treated with misogyny, she was also treated with such ugly racism. My overall feeling about this book is compassion...sadness. I feel for Harry. He made a choice and chose his family -- Meghan and their kids. He chose sanity. And regardless of how he chose to tell his story, Spare is a revelation of the kind of machinations the throne drives into controlling the facade we all see.

Rating 3 out of 5,"I have SO many conflicting thoughts on this. I did not love the style this was written in and actively chafed against it at the beginning, and I also feel like the first half of the book felt (understandably) aimless at times. It took me a few days to get to the 50% mark, but then after he meets Megan the writing becomes much more clear and precise and compelling (and for me personally, easier to read). He obviously knows what he wants to say here and presents his case super convincingly. Two things I did find surprising: maybe it was unrealistic on my part, but I sort of expected him to at least acknowledge that the monarchy is an inherently flawed and outdated institution, which he skirts around the edges of as an argument, but claims to still wholeheartedly support. Secondly, I get his relationship with the press and it makes complete sense, but sometimes his full-on hatred of them spills over into this weird money relationship like oh, common people are great most of the time, but so many of them are just doing things for the MONEY like, yeah? It's just a crazy attitude coming from someone who never had to worry about it until very late in life. P.S. Never would have guessed that I would come out of this book respecting Charles as a father? And no surprise if you've seen excerpts/spoilers but William comes out looking the worst by FAR, way more than I expected, woof.

Rating 5 out of 5,"Genres: Nonfiction/AutobiographyI was thinking this was going to be a trainwreck with lots of finger pointing. Well, it was kind of that, but I thoroughly enjoyed this one. Controversy follows that family. First, this was well written. Memoirs are usually the opposite of that. And I listened to the audio and it too was well done. So yay for that. It was nice to hear Prince Harry's perspective. And the whole Megan saga was heartbreaking. People can be so mean. What I find sad is that his family is what it is. They should be content and actively engaged in making life better for their people and their family. But no. It sounds like every member of that family carries their own pain and they use whatever power they possess (and let's face it some have far greater power than others,) and they use that power to hit/hurt back. One member of that family (with power) needs to be actively engaged in bringing that family back together.

I knew she impacted me and I remember the day the it was announced to the world of her death. I was crushed.

Rating 5 out of 5,"This one is really polarizing for a lot of people. First, I love a memoir. Second, and admittedly, I have been Team Harry/Meghan for a long time, but after all the publicity lately, I wondered why they didn't just shut up and live the quiet life they asked for. This book answered all of those questions. I listened to the audiobook, which is narrated by Harry. It felt like such an intimate storytelling of his life, which is a bit Shakespearean. He suffered such a trauma at a young age and never really got over it, partly due to himself and partly due to circumstance. Before this, I didn't realize that the ""stiff upper lip"" of the royal family extended to behind closed doors, but the fact that these family members don't show any form of affection to one another explains why they are all so troubled. I didn't walk away from this read thinking that he and Meghan are flawless- the fact that they told people about their pregnancy at someone else's wedding is one of the most selfish things I've ever heard, and her calling him ""H"" is pretty cringe. I also know entirely too much about his penis. But I also think that William cares far more about himself and the crown than any member of the family. At the core of it I think Harry and Meghan are two people that are very in love and that wanted the best for their children, and knew that living in that bubble wasn't it. Some of their actions along the way are cringe, but regardless, they are free.

Rating 4 out of 5,"I have mixed feelings about this. First, I feel like Harry shorted himself in the sense that he should’ve wrote 3 books. The first about his childhood, the second about his time in the war and his pre Megan years and then finally, the Megan years. There were little tidbits that I really wish he would’ve expounded on leading up to the last quarter of the book, which I was enraptured with. The first 3/4 wasn’t bad per say, it just didn’t hold my interest as the last quarter did. I’ve never been a big Royal fan and this is exactly why. It’s all a carefully crafted lie. That’s why I didn’t believe the crap that was being put out about Megan. And it was solidified when they decided to leave the royal family. It was said a thousand times but I’ll say it again, Harry is the husband that Charles was not. The behavior of the royal family, I’m talking about Charles and Will, was deplorable, the media was even worse. It feels odd to say that I’m proud of Harry, but that’s how I feel.

Rating 3 out of 5,"As a casual reader, this was a bit of a slog. As a historian, I'm glad this primary source exists for us to re-analyze in future decades. My main takeaways: - Harry was never cut out for the monarchy. He'd much rather have adventures outdoors than sit in a office reading. Public speaking gave him panic attacks for years. No longer being a ""working royal"" is probably the best thing he could have done for himself. - Harry is not a great writer. Did anyone even edit this? It's just a bunch of rambling sentences with awkward pacing. Like any soldier or EMT, he loves detailing gross injuries - but we didn't need quite so many, um. specific details. - Harry's mental health journey is his most compelling narrative. His cycles of denial and anger as a young man are textbook examples of unprocessed grief. Seeing him find solace in sports, nature, and animals was inspiring. His compassion for fellow combat veterans is compelling, and I hope he can lean into helping others that way. - Meghan's California girl personality was bound to ruffle some feathers, and both she and Harry could have navigated that better. How could she not do more research for the transatlantic role of a lifetime? It's both hilarious and sad that her very American gestures of friendship to Kate, like asking to borrow lip gloss or commiserating about post-partum ""baby brain"", were horrifying to the future Princess of Wales. - William, not Charles, is who antagonizes Harry the most. Harry finds his dad nerdy, annoying and sometimes overbearing, but describes ""Willy"" as aloof and petty, refusing Harry's attempts to bond.- The Firm is a classic toxic workplace - providing insufficient onboarding of new hires and then complaining when they don't follow office procedures, finally granting meetings but never following up on proposed plans, hosting ""discussions"" where you are told what they already decided, siloed departments unaware of each other's goals, assistants grasping to whatever power trip they can, and above it all, a CEO who is nice but always overbooked and oblivious to the dysfunction outside her door. I'd look for a new job too. - All three Windsor men are stuck in a system that hurts them and makes them hurt each other. They come across as three chained dogs snarling at each other, each desperate to maintain some territory and defend their wives' honor.

After reading this, though, you can see why Harry and his wife made the decisions they did (including writing this book). Fully understanding that there are two sides to every story, they appear to be the only ones seeing history repeating itself and wanting to go to any length necessary to avoid that happening. I was struck by how much trauma Harry endured in his life —starting at such a young age—and how little support he received in dealing with it, and I was touched at how his mother is, to this day, so much a part of his story.

Harry gives credit where it's due and takes responsibility for bad choices, but he's not afraid to call people out. I felt it was very sincere. I also felt like he was left with no other option than to tell his story himself. He was fed up with the version of his story spun by the media (with or without the support of the crown... their symbiotic relationship is a little warped, at best), and I think he at least wanted his side of the story out there on some level. We can make our own choice about what to believe, if it's our right to even have an opinion... ? I'm glad I listened to the audio book... it was nice hearing the story in Harry's own voice. I teared up a few times, both from sadness and from touching sweetness.

Rating 4 out of 5,"We all know a ghostwriter helped Harry with this, so I’m not commenting on the writing, just the content.The tea isn’t piping hot, but it is tea and honestly it’s everything I expected. Harry needed/needs a real family and his family of origin is nowhere close to what a family should be, so he’s making his own and calling out the injustices his family has been/is subjecting both him, his wife and others to. Obviously that’s upsetting to the family of origin. For a family that loves to champion mental health related causes, its even more evident that Harry actually believes in these causes. Didn’t have a lot of respect for Will going into this but his describing Harry as being brainwashed because Harry sees a therapist and is actually doing the work to process things in a healthy way is just… wow. The audacity and hypocrisy is THICK.I commend PH for sharing his story, knowing it would further the rift in his family, though we could have done with a lot less “todger” information. Parts are cringey, probably should have been edited out, but also it just adds to a better understanding of who PH is. I wish for nothing but peace, health and love for PH, M, and their family.

Rating 2 out of 5,"Spare By Prince Harry“I love my Mother Country, and I love my family, and I always will. I just wish, at the second-darkest moment of my life, they'd been there for me too.And I believe they'll look back one day and wish they had too.”Popsugar Reading Challenge Prompt: A celebrity memoir2/5 stars ⭐️⭐️Despite being British I’m not a fan of the Royal Family. I am extremely left wing and a bit of a socialist, so one family holding onto that much wealth and being protected when they commit crime doesn’t sit well with me. Harry and Meghan sparked my interest, however, when they stood up and started speaking out against the institution. I watched their documentary and found them instantly likeable and had sympathy for them.I was therefore surprised at how disappointed I was with his book. He doesn’t discuss the history of the structural racism and classism that’s inherent in the British monarchy. He doesn’t discuss serious issues such as Prince Andrew and the sex trafficking. Instead he mostly talks about petty gripes and fights he has with his family or his army experiences and killing Taliban. It was just a bit… boring? The first few chapters cover the death of his mother which were heartbreaking, and I do feel for that hurt little boy, but the rest was just flat. The writing was average and when Meghan came into his life there was nothing new here that wasn’t covered in the documentary. There are better memoirs out there, people.

Rating 1 out of 5,"I really had high hopes for this one, because I love a good memoir and I love me a British accent, but after 3 hours of mummy, daddy, Willy, and my darling boy, I had to stop this 16 hour audible. It wasn't worth the time investment. I felt the book was badly written and most chapters had no substance (no humor, no learning), which is a shame because I thought the life of royal would be pretty interesting (inno akid more interesting than my life in Saida, but even that didn't come across). What I got from those hours is: 1) Haram Harry. His childhood was super traumatic, and didn't get the right tools to deal with it. 2) He tends to play the victim card too often (ya Harry, everyone's older brother ignored their little sibling at school, itsokey).

Rating 1 out of 5,"Ello. I'm Harry. I was known as the playboy prince, in the media, and Europe's most eligible bachelor. Then Meghan took my heart, simply because she was so un-British, then painted herself out to be the same victim as my mother.  Then I was inspired to take out all my unresolved issues on my family, simply because my personality is so different than theirs. Now I want to pull a Hannah Montana, and have the best of both worlds. I want to be known as the upstanding royal like my brother, but also the rebellious rascal I was known for as-Perhaps the only validation I really enjoyed.

Rating 5 out of 5,"If you are able to listen to this book on audio, I highly recommend you do so. Listening to Prince Harry tell his story, with his own voice and his own words, was incredibly moving. I felt an unbelievable amount of emotion for this man and I truly don't want to hear anyone else's opinion on this one. This isn't fiction, it's not up for discussion. I don't really like ""reviewing"" memoirs, because it's not my place to comment on someone else's life story, but I do feel the need to share a few words on this one. Just because someone is born into a life of privilege, doesn't mean they aren't entitled to having their own feelings, thoughts and overall life desires. Trauma is real, for everyone, and being blasted in the media and not allowed a single moment of privacy will most certainly make that trauma worse. What people have said about this book, taken it out of context and blown it out of proportion, are the reason why Harry felt the need to get this book out in to the world.

Rating 2 out of 5,"This book took way too long to read and that's because it is equal parts unhinged, sad, and incredibly boring. I learned the word ""todger"" and I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not. Harry putting Mummy's face cream on his dick and feeling weird about that was something that could have stayed between him and god and yet here we are. I liked the part when Harry chased a Afghani guy on a motorbike with his Apache helicopter and then shot him with a 30mm cannon because the motorbike reminded him of the paparazzi. Then Harry immediately went on a rant about how outrageous it was that there was a guy who reviewed videos of their combat for possible war crimes, and how that guy was just mean and probably jealous he didn't get to fire missiles at dudes on motorbikes. Imagine being the guy whose entire job it was to watch videos of horrors beyond his comprehension over and over again to make sure no one was blowing up shepherds and schoolkids and just getting randomly roasted by Prince Harry for doing said job. My only other thought is that I sincerely hope Harry attempts to usurp the throne one day. A good old palace coup could be just the thing to breathe new life into the Monarchy and nobody really likes Charles so he really ought to consider this.Show more",2,This book took way too long to read and thats because it is equal parts unhinged sad and incredibly boring I learned the word todger and Im not sure if thats a good thing or not Harry putting Mummys face cream on his dick and feeling weird about that was something that could have stayed between him and god and yet here we are I liked the part when Harry chased a Afghani guy on a motorbike with his Apache helicopter and then shot him with a 30mm cannon because the motorbike reminded him of the paparazzi Then Harry immediately went on a rant about how outrageous it was that there was a guy who reviewed videos of their combat for possible war crimes and how that guy was just mean and probably jealous he didnt get to fire missiles at dudes on motorbikes Imagine being the guy whose entire job it was to watch videos of horrors beyond his comprehension over and over again to make sure no one was blowing up shepherds and schoolkids and just getting randomly roasted by Prince Harry for doing said job My only other thought is that I sincerely hope Harry attempts to usurp the throne one day A good old palace coup could be just the thing to breathe new life into the Monarchy and nobody really likes Charles so he really ought to consider thisShow more

His perspective is unique and enlightening- but I often wondered… is this true, did he really feel like that?

Rating 4 out of 5,"“My problem has never been with the monarchy, nor the concept of monarchy. It’s been with the press and the sick relationship that’s evolved between it and the Palace.” - Prince Harry, Spare, page 386. There, I just read Spare so you wouldn’t have to. That is it, in a nutshell. Unpack the nutshell, though, and my feelings about this book are complicated. (So is he.) At first, the fact that he had a ghostwriter was so glaringly obvious that it drove me to distraction. In the same section - heck, maybe even the same page - where he talks about how he was a terrible student, hates to read, and is a terrible writer, there is malarkey such as, “Its surface was a poreless cheek, which he often lightly stroked.” About a river in Africa! What?! At least make SOME attempt to fool me into thinking you wrote this, Harry. There are way too many ridiculous turns of phrase to mention, and I’ve already terrorized a group text of my coworkers with the worst of them. I won’t do it again here. But once he gets into the nitty gritty that, let’s face it, we’re all here for, most of that superfluous language is gone, and it actually sounds like it was written by the person who lived it. These are the parts that sounded the most genuine. He is shocked, hurt, outraged, and furiously angry at a lot of people. And he really loves Meghan, so get used to it. Bottom line: a shocking amount of this book is fairly boring. Most of the juicy parts I’d already read in pearl-clutching articles from the British press. I’m glad I read it, but it’s really not much he hasn’t already told Oprah, Anderson Cooper, and Netflix producers. But I am happy for him that he’s sold enough books to keep his family secure.

Rating 4 out of 5,"I wrote my review & before I could post it, it disappeared. So I will just say I’m glad I read Harry’s perspective of his life. And that is what a memoir is, after all…their take on their life. No memoir (or life) has ever been scrutinized to the extent this book has. The world loves it or hates it…loves him or hates him…thinks he’s telling the truth or lying (or influenced by his manipulative wife). I laugh because life is not black or white…like a divorce there’s his truth, her truth or the actual truth.We will never know what really took place but from my perspective, this is a story of a young boy who lost his mother due to the constant harassment of the press. A boy who grew up in a bubble that we can’t imagine…and a man who watched the press’s unrelenting harassment possibly cause a repeat of the most tragic event in his life.

(Highly recommend the audio narrated by Price Harry!)I’ve never followed the royals super closely, but have had an interest and was excited about this memoir. The writing about Diana and Meghan was so moving and tender. It never felt cheesy, but like Harry was baring the deepest parts of his soul as he shared the grief of losing his mom so tragically, and finding an equal partner in Meghan. The chapters about his time in the military dragged on a bit for me, but they were interesting and obviously formative in Harry’s character and values. He really left no stone unturned and there were a few stories that felt cringey, but it was also fascinating and a bit endearing to learn about some of his most private moments.

Most of what I've seen and heard on the news has been refuted by this book and I can't help but feel terrible for the lives they have all been thrust into. The accounts of the treatment of both him and William are appalling. Harry's book was insightful. He's very down to earth and unassuming.

Rating 4 out of 5,"Since watching the Oprah interview & Netflix special, I got the main idea of H & M’s story, but this memoir dives deeper into Harry’s life; from his mothers death, his time in the army, to meeting Meghan, and finally his Grandmother, the Queen’s death.The main theme that I got wasn’t that he hated his family or even the institution, but that he hated the media, the British tabloids and the constant lies that they published. And thus the aftermath of these stories had caused rifts between him and his family, which ultimately led him to the place he’s at now.As a fan of the Royals, I find it sad and upsetting to see a family torn apart by the media. Not to say that the family didn’t play a role, or are partially to blame for the series of events, but I truly think if the media hadn’t been as vulgar and mean, things may have played out differently.I really hope one day the Fab 4 can find themselves together again, because I think they can make so many changes in this world for the better.

And they are harassed to the point of danger and not kept safe.

Rating 4 out of 5,"Audiobook Harry is a good narrator and I enjoyed listening to this but I knocked off a star since a lot of it was familiar already. I don’t suppose that any of us will ever know the full truth but I’m inclined to believe most of what he says. It’s not hard to believe he was traumatized by Diana’s death and that the weird, formal, fishbowl of royal life wasn’t great for his mental health. He didn’t ask for any of that and can’t be blamed for how that great loss made him feel. I don’t know how anybody can listen to the first half of this book and not feel bad about how lonely he seemed to be. The rest of the drama between Harry, Charles, and William is sad. I think they are all right from their own POV. Hopefully someday they can all move past it but probably not. If I were a Harry, I’d have done whatever I could to get away from that life.Show more",4,Audiobook Harry is a good narrator and I enjoyed listening to this but I knocked off a star since a lot of it was familiar already I dont suppose that any of us will ever know the full truth but Im inclined to believe most of what he says Its not hard to believe he was traumatized by Dianas death and that the weird formal fishbowl of royal life wasnt great for his mental health He didnt ask for any of that and cant be blamed for how that great loss made him feel I dont know how anybody can listen to the first half of this book and not feel bad about how lonely he seemed to be The rest of the drama between Harry Charles and William is sad I think they are all right from their own POV Hopefully someday they can all move past it but probably not If I were a Harry Id have done whatever I could to get away from that lifeShow more

He told his story with humility, not leaving out the parts that could be less flattering, and honesty.

Rating 4 out of 5,"There is no better way to read this book than audio with Prince Harry as narrator recounting his memories. His childhood, teens, army, adventures, charity work, are all in his voice. His struggles, pain, grief, and happiness laid out in his words. There are many good and bad reviews around Spare. Is it truth? Is Harry right or wrong? I don’t think that’s the point. These are Harry’s thoughts and his memories. Plain and simple. You cannot choose the circumstances and family you are born into. It’s what you choose do with your life that counts. Harry has chosen to live his life on his terms, right or wrong. Prince Harry seems to be sincere in this book. Recalling the good and bad of being a prince in a paparazzi infested British monarchy. Harry seems to be an affectionate man. A man devoted to the real people in his life. A man who loved serving in his nations military. A witty man who can poke fun at himself when deserving. A man who never fit the royal mold from birth. That’s my take on Harry.

Rating 5 out of 5,"First off a lot of people are hating on this book without having read it. The one thing I’ll say is this: most of the quotes you see are posted without context or put in a way to make it look bad. He even managed to humanize Charles and make people understand him more, something I have to admit I’d never thought I’d say. I’m glad to finally have Harry’s story through his words and not the words of every single person who has an opinion on this and the tabloids. There’s a lot of grief in this book, a lot of grief that was repressed for a long time. If writing this book gave Harry the peace he needed, then I’m glad he did.One thing is clear, he loved the Queen dearly and without shame. « In every photo of us, whenever we’re exchanging a glance, making solid eye contact, it’s clear: We had secrets.”“Special relationship, that’s what they said about us, and now I couldn’t stop thinking about the specialness that would no longer be.

That’s all I kept thinking a young boy who obviously needed closure and therapy and some additional love after the tragic death of his mom but was forced to continue to live out his grief under the scrutiny and eye of the press.

In a world where we take bullying seriously, how can the media and press still be allowed to conduct business in the way that they do?This book is his way of speaking out his own truths. I get it, there are two sides to every story (three maybe including the press?) so while I would love to hear the rebuttal and the palace’s thoughts, we will never. A boy, now man, that has loved others and carries on the legacy of his late mother. I admire him for his strength and his ability to continue therapy as an adult, stand by his proclamation and his love and family, and make a path for himself outside of his family.

I pre-ordered this book, and I almost canceled it because the prince had done so much press. I thought I knew the contents of the book. I am pleased that I did not.In addition to helping an American like me understand how and where this family exists and how they “work“, it contains the most insightful, compelling, heart wrenching portrait of PTSD that I have ever read. I am not even sure that the author meant for many portions of the book to reveal his PTSD, but it is raw and it is ugly and it is beautiful. I’m not sure this book prompts me to care about royalty any more than I did a week ago, but it was a very good read. It’s a book full of personal insight, and most likely a fair bit of spin doctoring, but when we have an outsized audience don’t we want to protect our image?

Rating 5 out of 5,"This was both a lot better (his ghostwriter is GOOD) and also a harder read than I expected. I know Prince Harry’s story from my long obsession with the BRF but I was still surprised by much of what he shares.

Rating 5 out of 5,"Until one steps into someone else's shoes, no one has the right to criticize. This is Harry's truth and I for one appreciate learning what he went through - and continues to go through.He has lost everything of his former life not because he is seeking attention as some say, but because there is deep hurt, trauma and lack of love & support from the people who should have had his back! THAT's what family is for! To have your back. To meet you halfway. To listen, care, love and support you. Reading Harry's story made me hurt for him that he did not and possibly never will have from his cold blooded relatives! We all have a fantasy and sick obsession of the life of the Royals as if they are irreproachable and can do no wrong. Every single human being is flawed in one way or another. Harry is no different, but it is HIS truth and his story.I see someone who is in deep pain. Someone who has been abandoned by the people he most trusted and called ""family"". How many of us know of someone in a similar position? Who has been abandoned by the people that are supposed to have your back no matter what? For people to say he is seeking attention or he should have kept it to himself, I see it differently. If you were in his shoes and running into a brick wall where every day someone compiles hurt after hurt and refuses to listen or make any changes, how do you strike back? Do you sit and take it? I don't think so. I applaud Harry & Meghan for taking off the blinkers and giving us a true picture of these people & that life that we all look on as fantasy.Harry has a wife and kids to protect. He is not alone anymore to take the hurt onto himself and keep quiet. No one deserves the treatment they got, whether you believe his truth or not it does not make it untrue either. No one seeks to be abandoned by their family & country. He didn't ask for it. He simply asked to be respected and I see no respect or love from the Royals - especially his Father & brother who should always have his back no matter what!For this reason, I applaud Harry for coming out with his story. I will never again look at Charles & William in the same way. I am quite honestly disgusted with them at this point and hope Harry & Meghan have a great life and find piece and happiness with their little family and those close to them.Show more",5,Until one steps into someone elses shoes no one has the right to criticize This is Harrys truth and I for one appreciate learning what he went through  and continues to go throughHe has lost everything of his former life not because he is seeking attention as some say but because there is deep hurt trauma and lack of love  support from the people who should have had his back THATs what family is for To have your back To meet you halfway To listen care love and support you Reading Harrys story made me hurt for him that he did not and possibly never will have from his cold blooded relatives We all have a fantasy and sick obsession of the life of the Royals as if they are irreproachable and can do no wrong Every single human being is flawed in one way or another Harry is no different but it is HIS truth and his storyI see someone who is in deep pain Someone who has been abandoned by the people he most trusted and called family How many of us know of someone in a similar position Who has been abandoned by the people that are supposed to have your back no matter what For people to say he is seeking attention or he should have kept it to himself I see it differently If you were in his shoes and running into a brick wall where every day someone compiles hurt after hurt and refuses to listen or make any changes how do you strike back Do you sit and take it I dont think so I applaud Harry  Meghan for taking off the blinkers and giving us a true picture of these people  that life that we all look on as fantasyHarry has a wife and kids to protect He is not alone anymore to take the hurt onto himself and keep quiet No one deserves the treatment they got whether you believe his truth or not it does not make it untrue either No one seeks to be abandoned by their family  country He didnt ask for it He simply asked to be respected and I see no respect or love from the Royals  especially his Father  brother who should always have his back no matter whatFor this reason I applaud Harry for coming out with his story I will never again look at Charles  William in the same way I am quite honestly disgusted with them at this point and hope Harry  Meghan have a great life and find piece and happiness with their little family and those close to themShow more

Rating 5 out of 5,"This is one of those books that I couldn't put down! I loved the writing style! It was concise and brilliant. There are probably reasons that I related to this book when some of my friends didn't. I, of course, was a huge fan of Diana! Her death was one of those things that we remember where we were when we heard about it. Like the Challenger disaster and the World Trade Center. I was at Dairy Queen and weeping while reading the paper. The world wept on that day. We wept again when we watched her two little boys walking behind the hearse. Heartbreaking!  I also touched base again with him when he was in the military. Since I joined the Air Force at nineteen. I found all of that fascinating! I kept comparing the British military with the US.  Then he got out and felt a bit lost. I feel for ya, brother!  Time keeps passing and he is in search of his future. Then he meets the most beautiful woman in the world. The first time I saw Meagan on Suits I was floored by her beauty. But, to hear about all of the other stuff she does? How could he not fall in love? The two of them could have done wonderful things for Britain, if the paparazzi would have just disappeared. Every good book needs a villain, and this is one of the worst! How many times have they scourged actors and actresses in this country? How many times have they been forced to run from the paps and try to protect their children? How about River Pheonix? Nicole Kidman? Reese Witherspoon? And Diana? They chased her into the tunnel. They photographed her dying instead of trying to help.

Rating 5 out of 5,"From my generational trauma lens and my deeply personal non profit work and lived experience in deeply loving people that risk their lives for the betterment of humanity as Veterans, there is so much to unpack here and I’m going to take some time to do it justice wholly.I will say this, I have deep awareness of how trauma led Harry to write this while understanding how trauma led his parents to choose their own paths. The history in those generations and the care available to them in healing matters most to fully grasp where one can agree and disagree on what Harry did here. I think Harry was trying to make sense of that all at an age in life and a time he maybe should have given more space to in healing before writing about it. I agree with the critics that say, he may regret some of these revelations about his family’s most personal moments (the ones that don’t truly matter in the objectives or writing this) but perhaps he showed his full deck at this moment by daring greatly in trying to help us to understand why he gave up life as he knew it in complete protest of his “assigned” role entirely at birth. Not to mention the immense and entirely unique pain he experienced in living through it up to this point. Only time and him continuing to heal will tell. I have deep appreciation for his desire to set this pain free, it’s something of his fame and privilege so rarely do. I think ultimately it will be transformational most. It’s obvious Harry, like me, so deeply wanted to be let out of the cage he had been born into emotionally. I would say he has achieved that objective here, to say the least. This book will serve as a great tool in what I will choose to include and not include in my own published works, and a North Star as to when I choose to publish such things while choosing which audience I choose to have access to it, first and foremost.

Rating 4 out of 5,"I’ve thought a lot about this book and I want to add my fuel to the fire. I don’t usually write this big of a review but I feel this book is such the hot topic.  I’ve spent the last year listening to various memoirs. This was not the best but it was interesting. I can’t say I’d recommend it exactly but it is a perspective we never hear. What I liked most about it: The Royal family is an entity none of us really understand. In that this was the most honest portrayal we’ll ever see of it. I also felt Harry was pretty honest about his failings.I think this was the best argument against maintaining the monarchy and this system. It is an antiquated system that is truly serving no purpose. This isn’t a family, it’s a business. Wrapping my head around your granny who is also the queen of England and how many layers of fucked up are in there. I appreciated what I understood as his message: he isn’t saying Meghan was treated any worse than anyone else (except there being a racial issue that can’t be ignored here). But he was saying that this system, has hurt all of them and it isn’t right. Because it isn’t. I viscerally felt his description of feeling trapped. This was a never a family helping each other but a business maintaining itself. I felt he very clearly expressed what was so fucked about what happened to his mom. The twist of how they chased her down but then reported about the victims blood alcohol or lack of seatbelts. Classic victim blaming. No one has ever held these monsters accountable and Harry is 100% correct in railing against them. It’s gross. And I think he explains that well. Where I think it missed? He admitted his failings but somehow Meg didn’t have a single one. She never said or did a single thing wrong. That felt disingenuous. I adore my husband. I can tell you all his faults easily. It doesn’t change my love. There was a tone deafness in it. I really felt like Harry is trying to learn and be a better person. He admits to being uneducated and spoiled. I credit him for this. But, where I see issue, was he seemed to be railing against all of us in a way. Not overtly but it also never tried to appeal to us all and how we are all trapped and what he learned about life and being trapped. Who is the press chasing them all for? Because we are the ones reading and consuming their stories. And he isn’t wrong about that. There were relatable moments of being trapped in your life. His in a very different way than anything I could understand but we can all relate to overbearing parents. Unreasonable expectations. Sibling rivalry that turns dirty. But also, he had the means to walk away and live in a beautiful mansion that a celebrity gave to them. The rest of us have to figure out how to deal. And that is really where I feel like he missed an opportunity. To appeal to all of us as equal humans. As a human who wants to save his family. But he never does. And in that element it did feel kind of whiny. Poor Prince Harry and his millions of dollars. Life sucks but you can pay to get out of it. He couldn’t make that emotional connection for the reader to my life and how we are all human. That is a shame because there was so much about this that was really honest and expressed in a way I could feel empathy for him. But because he never extended the empathy back to me the reader he missed that. I believe him stepping down was the right move. As he says repeatedly. He’s the spare. The Royal machine doesn’t need him. He has no need to maintain the status quo and good on him for stepping back. I hope he continues therapy and I hope he continues to figure out how to fight against the ugliness that is perpetuated by the press. I think he has a great message. He needs to figure out how to relate to normal people. Something he’s never had to do before. Show more",4,Ive thought a lot about this book and I want to add my fuel to the fire I dont usually write this big of a review but I feel this book is such the hot topic  Ive spent the last year listening to various memoirs This was not the best but it was interesting I cant say Id recommend it exactly but it is a perspective we never hear What I liked most about it The Royal family is an entity none of us really understand In that this was the most honest portrayal well ever see of it I also felt Harry was pretty honest about his failingsI think this was the best argument against maintaining the monarchy and this system It is an antiquated system that is truly serving no purpose This isnt a family its a business Wrapping my head around your granny who is also the queen of England and how many layers of fucked up are in there I appreciated what I understood as his message he isnt saying Meghan was treated any worse than anyone else except there being a racial issue that cant be ignored here But he was saying that this system has hurt all of them and it isnt right Because it isnt I viscerally felt his description of feeling trapped This was a never a family helping each other but a business maintaining itself I felt he very clearly expressed what was so fucked about what happened to his mom The twist of how they chased her down but then reported about the victims blood alcohol or lack of seatbelts Classic victim blaming No one has ever held these monsters accountable and Harry is 100 correct in railing against them Its gross And I think he explains that well Where I think it missed He admitted his failings but somehow Meg didnt have a single one She never said or did a single thing wrong That felt disingenuous I adore my husband I can tell you all his faults easily It doesnt change my love There was a tone deafness in it I really felt like Harry is trying to learn and be a better person He admits to being uneducated and spoiled I credit him for this But where I see issue was he seemed to be railing against all of us in a way Not overtly but it also never tried to appeal to us all and how we are all trapped and what he learned about life and being trapped Who is the press chasing them all for Because we are the ones reading and consuming their stories And he isnt wrong about that There were relatable moments of being trapped in your life His in a very different way than anything I could understand but we can all relate to overbearing parents Unreasonable expectations Sibling rivalry that turns dirty But also he had the means to walk away and live in a beautiful mansion that a celebrity gave to them The rest of us have to figure out how to deal And that is really where I feel like he missed an opportunity To appeal to all of us as equal humans As a human who wants to save his family But he never does And in that element it did feel kind of whiny Poor Prince Harry and his millions of dollars Life sucks but you can pay to get out of it He couldnt make that emotional connection for the reader to my life and how we are all human That is a shame because there was so much about this that was really honest and expressed in a way I could feel empathy for him But because he never extended the empathy back to me the reader he missed that I believe him stepping down was the right move As he says repeatedly Hes the spare The Royal machine doesnt need him He has no need to maintain the status quo and good on him for stepping back I hope he continues therapy and I hope he continues to figure out how to fight against the ugliness that is perpetuated by the press I think he has a great message He needs to figure out how to relate to normal people Something hes never had to do before Show more

Rating 4 out of 5,"Soooo many thoughts about this book. I recently watched Harry & Meghan's docuseries on Netflix and was floored by how much it changed my mind about them. I had already planned on reading Spare, but now I went into it even more open-minded than I might have before. And now, I'm a total convert. Listening to Harry read the book was a game changer - just reading it wouldn't have felt quite the same. He sounded so raw and genuine and earnest in getting his story out there. I liked the beginning and the end, but part II about his military career was a bit too long and drawn out. I appreciate how much the military shaped him and such but I got the point after a while. Clearly, a huge takeaway that you could get within the first few pages is the profound effect two things had on him - his mother's death and the paps. This is heavily repeated throughout to the point where I was like yes, okay, I get it Harry. But, this book is clearly therapeutic for him and who am I to judge that? As someone who grew up with loads of exposure to the royals from my British side of the family, I am invested in Harry and his happiness and am so happy to see him finally figuring things out and getting to a place where he can be happy.

Rating 5 out of 5,"Whether or not Prince Harry knows this, this book, at its heart, is a book for the grieving. Grief has permeated every aspect of his life, as well as his family’s, and to the untrained eye that can be hard to identify. But to another person who has experienced big, life altering grief, it’s plain as day. Regardless of the drama, the anecdotes, both which had me interested throughout, it was the thread of grief that will make me think of this book long after I’ve finished it. It’s a common language, a language of heartbreak and hurt, that when you see it in someone else, you see yourself reflected back, and this whole grief thing then feels a little less lonely.Show more",5,Whether or not Prince Harry knows this this book at its heart is a book for the grieving Grief has permeated every aspect of his life as well as his familys and to the untrained eye that can be hard to identify But to another person who has experienced big life altering grief its plain as day Regardless of the drama the anecdotes both which had me interested throughout it was the thread of grief that will make me think of this book long after Ive finished it Its a common language a language of heartbreak and hurt that when you see it in someone else you see yourself reflected back and this whole grief thing then feels a little less lonelyShow more
Rating 2 out of 5,"There were moments in this memoir that definitely touched me, and while I feel sympathy for Harry’s emotional trauma (particularly around losing his mother and feeling helpless to protect Meghan and his family from unrelenting scrutiny and familial cruelty), his memoir as a whole lacked cohesion and could have used like 500 more hours of editing and 10 more years of therapy prior to publication. Every time I felt moved by moments of really lovely introspection, everything was then immediately undercut by some extremely immature, odd, or unnecessary details. Admittedly, Part 3 (aka introduction of Meg through present day) was a much better read than the first two parts.Show more",2,There were moments in this memoir that definitely touched me and while I feel sympathy for Harrys emotional trauma particularly around losing his mother and feeling helpless to protect Meghan and his family from unrelenting scrutiny and familial cruelty his memoir as a whole lacked cohesion and could have used like 500 more hours of editing and 10 more years of therapy prior to publication Every time I felt moved by moments of really lovely introspection everything was then immediately undercut by some extremely immature odd or unnecessary details Admittedly Part 3 aka introduction of Meg through present day was a much better read than the first two partsShow more

Rating 4 out of 5,"This reads very stream of conscious like— it almost feels like you sat down one day with someone who’d had one too many drinks and couldn’t stop talking, words just pouring out. While that makes for a very readable (and eyebrow raising) story, it does feel a bit meandering at times. All in all, the reader gets the very palpable sense of Harry’s feelings of hurt, anger, and a profound betrayal. It’s a story of a broken boy who grows up to be a broken man, who does the work to try and heal that part of himself and ends up looking around and going WTF is happening. There are a number of stories, though, where I’d definitely like a few more perspectives on things (there were more than a few where I was wondering about alternate explanations or additional context). All in all though, it definitely made me feel sympathetic for the life of a multimillionaire royal prince and that assuredly isn’t an easy accomplishment. But phew, Harry does no favors for his brother in this book. Of all the family, William seems to come off the worse— petulant, petty, angry, and, in general, and rather small and unlikeable person. Yikes for the future king lolShow more",4,This reads very stream of conscious like it almost feels like you sat down one day with someone whod had one too many drinks and couldnt stop talking words just pouring out While that makes for a very readable and eyebrow raising story it does feel a bit meandering at times All in all the reader gets the very palpable sense of Harrys feelings of hurt anger and a profound betrayal Its a story of a broken boy who grows up to be a broken man who does the work to try and heal that part of himself and ends up looking around and going WTF is happening There are a number of stories though where Id definitely like a few more perspectives on things there were more than a few where I was wondering about alternate explanations or additional context All in all though it definitely made me feel sympathetic for the life of a multimillionaire royal prince and that assuredly isnt an easy accomplishment But phew Harry does no favors for his brother in this book Of all the family William seems to come off the worse petulant petty angry and in general and rather small and unlikeable person Yikes for the future king lolShow more

Rating 3 out of 5,"I’ve been a royal watcher/fan for decades in spite of being right in-between Harry and William in age…suffice it to say, I had odd hobbies as I grew up. Because of that, it was nice to hear from Prince Harry himself (I listened to the audiobook) instead of just reading books or articles from others. However, he alerts the reader early on that he is not the most reliable narrator because he there are lots of conversations, events, and other details about his life that he can’t remember well or at all. That’s fair, but it did beg the question as the book went on, what is an actual memory, what is an assumption that your grown-up self is assuming about your childhood self, and what is just re-imagining past events in a way you thought they should go or wanted them to go? Due to that, I jotted down notes as I listened about things that stood out to me and wished could have been answered in a Q&A with the author (or at least wished an editor had asked him to expound on more). Those notes are my “review”:-Granted there’s a lot about British culture I don’t understand, but from my American perspective, some of Harry’s issues probably had less to do with his family being royal, and more to do with growing up in a boarding school were matrons take the place of your parents in providing nurture and help you bathe until you turn 13. Once again…I realize that’s normal for a certain social class in England, but from a middle-class American perspective, that right there made me wonder how hard/easy it is to develop healthy relationships later on in life.-He claims he was labeled the naughty one in school, and wanted to be thought of as noble. He is, in fact, being “naughty” (sneaking out at night to drink, smoke, get high while a young teen). He records this without any sense of irony.-he remembers that his mother didn’t like his nanny Tiggy (a well-recorded fact), but remembers always being thrilled when Tiggy was around and adoring her. He thinks he might have felt guilty about loving Tiggy, but doesn’t remember, but thinks he should have. I had to pause and wonder why he felt it necessary to dwell on how he can’t remember guilt instead of just cherishing a part of childhood that he remembers as bringing him joy. It’s an early example of how Harry sets himself up for self-sabotage.-He also mentioned that since he needed a Fine Arts credit to graduate he had to be in a school production and was aggrieved that he was neither asked or consulted by the director about what part he would play and claims this is just one more example of a pitfall of being royal. At which point I just had to say, “duh…most high school theatre directors don’t let you choose your part. It’s a school play for crying out loud!”—he credits his helicopter instructor with “teaching me a lesson most people don’t know…the truth is painful.” I don’t know…I feel like most people know that…—His relationship with Chelsy Davy seemed like a bright spot in his life. I’ve wondered if she’ll end up being his Camilla and they’ll find their way back to each other again decades from now.—The last third of the book is devoted to his and Meghan’s relationship and dominated by the negative press articles. They seem to just consume him, which made me wonder, why not just ignore the articles? Why seek them out? Why not forbid your staff from bringing any into the house, why not *not* google yourself, etc? Why constantly fight them? He says he “had” to keep asking Meghan questions to find out what was true…why? That’s never really answered. It almost made me wonder if she and Harry trauma bonded in the early days of their relationship leaking and never really got a sense of what they liked about each other as a couple without constantly fighting the press.—He claims that if the palace had said one thing in defense of Meg at her first public outing it might have made a world of difference. He never says why he thinks that would be true or provides any insight to support that theory. I was wishing he would.-Harry was a child of divorce whose parents (amicably at times and not-so-amicably at others) parented and later split custody. He went to live at boarding school at a young age. When he was with his father over summer break he’d come check on his sons in the evening before leaving for “adults-only dinner” and then he and William would be on their own for hours. In short, his family was never that close. There weeks and months at a time when he wasn’t around his parents or his brothers. How much of that was a royal thing, divorce thing, and just extremely wealthy thing is hard to discern, but, the general gist is, they weren’t really all that close as people emotionally and often had physical distance separating them as well. For whatever reason, Harry seems to think his family should have been more warm and welcoming and close when he began dating Meg, but there’s no evidence that the family was ever all that close.—how did Harry not know the rules about asking the monarch’s permission to marry if you’re one of the first six in line of succession? I’m not royal, doesn’t apply to my life, and I knew that was a rule. It’s weird that he had time to read tabloids, but not actual news articles with legitimate information.—William warned Harry that dating Meghan would come with host of difficulties and this was the beginning of their now infamous falling-out. What I found interesting was 1) William was right 2) why be offended if you know you’re in love and this is right for you? Most close friends (which Harry desperately wanted his family to be) would give the same advice. Also…the truth hurts (see above)—At one point he mentions, “It was nice to remember the British press isn’t reality” and at that point I wanted to scream, “quit reading your own press!” It’s never a good idea. Most famous actors don’t. How has no one told Harry this? —in the chapters on the lead up to the wedding he says “we wanted to elope barefoot in Botswana. But we were expected to share this moment with other people, it wasn’t up to us.” Says who specifically? Who did you ask who said no? There was plenty of negative press about how much the wedding cost. Would someone have really nixed the idea of a simple wedding? And who did they ask who did?-he also mentions that he thought it was overkill to need a police escort for the wedding tiara…umm…we’re talking about a piece a jewelry that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars. Why does a police escort seem like overkill and the palace stalling. It seemed reasonable to me.—more on tiara-gate: much has been made of who made who cry. Harry’s perspective is only Meghan cried. But how were Harry and Meghan supposed to know whether or not Kate cried? The whole book is his perspective only and he never mentions asking.—it’s strange that he thinks it’s a huge invasion of trust/privacy for Meghan’s father to publish her letter, but doesn’t think anything of sharing Kate and Meghan’s texts. Once again, there’s sense of irony as he complains about other people violating their privacy while he does the same.—He claims they talked to Oprah because “we had to do something to make the attacks stop.” Still…why??? And why do you think that will work? Who knows? Certainly not Harry.—Overall, Harry has not had the easiest road to travel. Some of it is just learning to play the hand you’re dealt like everyone in life must. Some of it could have been avoided if he’d had either good sense or good advisors. Unfortunately, more often than not, it seems he had neither.-it’s hard to unravel how much of Harry’s complaints are actually related to the paparazzi, being part of the royal family, having parents who weren’t that great at parenting combined with losing his mother in a traumatic way, and just never getting over being second-born. After reading Spare I read “The Boys” written by Ron and Clint Howard about their childhood in Hollywood and growing up with varying degrees of fame. The parallels and divergences were fascinating because they both followed two brothers, one who was significantly more famous than the other, was well-known, and easily recognized for a time, and a younger brother who was never quite as famous, got into more trouble as a teen, struggled with drugs as an adult, but the family bond always stayed strong, and eventually he overcame his struggles.-Just a random thought as a relatively happy second born married to another relatively happy second born, who is raising a few middle children, maybe Harry should read “The Birth Order” book? You can be special and have a meaningful life no matter your position in the family. I’m not sure anyone has ever told him that (and Harry seems to really struggle to gain any type of perspective), but maybe he’d like to hear it.Show more",3,Ive been a royal watcherfan for decades in

 for the drama. I'm one of those Americans that finds the mystery behind the Royal Family intriguing – follow them on Instagram, watch The Crown and H&M's documentary, etc. So I definitely preordered Spare cause why not.First off, I appreciated how the memoir was organized: 3 separate parts (with photos on the title pages!), and then numbered chapters following. It doesn't waste any paper real estate by starting a chapter on a new page, just continuously flowed.This is Harry's opportunity to tell his side of the story, key point: his side. Specific facts might be incorrect (such is the case for remembering things in one's life 20+ years after the fact), and he makes it well known that his memory is spotty in places. That being said, it's a fairly complete in-depth dive from the most devastating day of his life to the present. No one can truly imagine the trauma he has gone through and dealt with, and I felt he did a decent job navigating those emotions in his words.I loved all the tea spilled throughout, from exchanges with Will and his father, to how he was treated as the ""Spare,"" to the short paragraph about how he lost his virginity (idk why people are so riled up about it, have you never read a smutty book? Pleaseeee it was PG), to the bits about his frostbitten todger (lol), and all the times Palace aids were destructive. Yes, he has seemed fairly naive at multiple times in his life, but I appreciated his ownership of those instances.In regards to his war period, I have never been a solider so I cannot claim what is or isn't dangerous to say. Harry has, and I thought he told his story thoroughly and honest to his experience. His war years take up a very large portion of the book, so obviously this is a time in his life that was pivotal.I felt the final part on his life once M came into the scene was glossed over a bit, but can be supplemented with the documentary I suppose. It still completely disgusts me how the press could be allowed to say such racist things. Moral of the story, the press sucks. H&M are happy.

 for the drama Im one of those Americans that finds the mystery behind the Royal Family intriguing  follow them on Instagram watch The Crown and HMs documentary etc So I definitely preordered Spare cause why notFirst off I appreciated how the memoir was organized 3 separate parts with photos on the title pages and then numbered chapters following It doesnt waste any paper real estate by starting a chapter on a new page just continuously flowedThis is Harrys opportunity to tell his side of the story key point his side Specific facts might be incorrect such is the case for remembering things in ones life 20 years after the fact and he makes it well known that his memory is spotty in places That being said its a fairly complete indepth dive from the most devastating day of his life to the present No one can truly imagine the trauma he has gone through and dealt with and I felt he did a decent job navigating those emotions in his wordsI loved all the tea spilled throughout from exchanges with Will and his father to how he was treated as the Spare to the short paragraph about how he lost his virginity idk why people are so riled up about it have you never read a smutty book Pleaseeee it was PG to the bits about his frostbitten todger lol and all the times Palace aids were destructive Yes he has seemed fairly naive at multiple times in his life but I appreciated his ownership of those instancesIn regards to his war period I have never been a solider so I cannot claim what is or isnt dangerous to say Harry has and I thought he told his story thoroughly and honest to his experience His war years take up a very large portion of the book so obviously this is a time in his life that was pivotalI felt the final part on his life once M came into the scene was glossed over a bit but can be supplemented with the documentary I suppose It still completely disgusts me how the press could be allowed to say such racist things Moral of the story the press sucks HM are happy Id love to one day hear the other side of the story but Im thinking thatll happen when pigs flyShow more"

I thought this was going to be a 3 when I started because I kept thinking to myself, “do we need all these details?” But as the story developed, I started to appreciate all the small stories and random moments he included. It was refreshing balance of hard hitting moments and seemingly mundane little ones. And it reminded me of the fact that a life really is mostly a collection of small every day stories. I partially listened to this on audiobook, but mostly read the ebook - I’d recommend reading it over listening to it! There’s something about hearing Harry talk about things like his todger in his own voice that I just couldn’t take seriously haha. I think regardless of if you support him or not, he deserves to be able to tell his own story. Everyone has that right. I loved it!

Rating 5 out of 5,"More than anything, this book is a story of grief. While I found it incredibly funny at times and I enjoyed some of the random anecdotes you can only get from someone who has lived a royal life, by the end I actually found myself crying. Harry is very open about his grief and the process of mourning his mom in a setting that doesn’t allow for mourning. As much as this story is about the media and how terrible they are (because wow yikes), this is a story of a little boy who lost his mom, which made him lose everything, and how he found happiness again. The ghost writer did a phenomenal job.

Rating 5 out of 5,"I was never someone who followed the Royal family and anything they were doing in the world. I was never interested when it came to William and Kate. I was only mildly interested when I heard Meghan and Harry were getting married. I only felt that way because she was biracial and it seemed like a huge narrative that a black woman becoming a princess was amazing. Like a long time coming for us or whatever. Then everything hit the fan and the next thing you know they were exiled?So, of course I had to read the book from the exiled! It had to be juicy! I went in a literal blank slate and he filled me up on knowledge plenty! Had I came in with preconceived notions or opinions on events already, maybe my view of the book would be different but I felt it was amazingly written and overwhelmingly informing. I see it as more of an autobiography than the memoirs I’m used to reading. It was 100% worth the read, but it took me a while because there were great parts and so-so parts. Part 1 was a landline of information on him and Royal life so I digested it quickly. Part 2 was heavy on the military and other stuff. I was highly intrigued with the military and war so that kept me interested but there were things that took me a while to get through in part 2. Part 3 brought in Meghan and I absolutely loved this part. However, it was interesting and hard to read at the same time in certain parts. My heart goes out to them. Yes, their lives aren’t anything like mine but it’s hard not to read this and feel the suffering they endured because of their family. It was a really good read and I’d recommend everyone to read it whether they’re a fan or not of the British Royals.Show more",5,I was never someone who followed the Royal family and anything they were doing in the world I was never interested when it came to William and Kate I was only mildly interested when I heard Meghan and Harry were getting married I only felt that way because she was biracial and it seemed like a huge narrative that a black woman becoming a princess was amazing Like a long time coming for us or whatever Then everything hit the fan and the next thing you know they were exiledSo of course I had to read the book from the exiled It had to be juicy I went in a literal blank slate and he filled me up on knowledge plenty Had I came in with preconceived notions or opinions on events already maybe my view of the book would be different but I felt it was amazingly written and overwhelmingly informing I see it as more of an autobiography than the memoirs Im used to reading It was 100 worth the read but it took me a while because there were great parts and soso parts Part 1 was a landline of information on him and Royal life so I digested it quickly Part 2 was heavy on the military and other stuff I was highly intrigued with the military and war so that kept me interested but there were things that took me a while to get through in part 2 Part 3 brought in Meghan and I absolutely loved this part However it was interesting and hard to read at the same time in certain parts My heart goes out to them Yes their lives arent anything like mine but its hard not to read this and feel the suffering they endured because of their family It was a really good read and Id recommend everyone to read it whether theyre a fan or not of the British RoyalsShow more

Rating 5 out of 5,"This is a beautifully crafted book. The memoir of someone still so young and full of life but who has certainly lived trauma. The death of his mother shook him. I'm sure it shook both young boys but William has been raised to take over the mantle one day so he has had to learn to be the entitled, the chosen, and he was unkind in his words about his mother's Panorama interview not all that long ago. Very sad. Then the word coming down from his grandmother, QEII, that he and William would indeed walk behind their mother's coffin in front of the entire world. So cold and inhuman. Terrible. Or course, the smiles had to be put on, and Harry was dissociating, so sure his mummy was in hiding and would return. Heart breaking enough, but add to this that no one had or has any warmth in this godforsaken Windsor family. Then later on the trauma coming back from being PTSD to present lived trauma, having to decide to protect his wife and children from the toxic air of the British Royals and their deal with the press, knowing that he had a big decision to make. He did not want his mother mark II. Such bravery he has, and if you have a skerrick of an idea what it's like to face a regular maladaptive family, let alone a whole institution of dysfunction, and this family is indeed dysfunctional and cruel, you would understand what he, and Meghan as well, have been through. If you don't understand it, I feel sorry for your lack of insight. 'And I realised what a complicated concept home had become.' I've never liked royalty. The whole bizarre pomp and ceremony concept that their lackey's pedal that you must bow and curtsy to someone who is like you and me - another human being. That they somehow have their (CofE) god as their supreme backer is funny, given the infidelities and entitled and unhealthy behaviours they manifest. I have no time for kneeling or prostrating myself to someone else. I don't watch royal weddings. I don't care especially what they do. However, I do feel they leech off the purse, and these royal watchers, these people who get so angry if you say a word about these entitled, wealthy people who don't even care one iota about them in return. And the words British Commonwealth are just a modernisation of the unpalatable, colonising British Empire. All the damage that that has done to many in the name of queen/or king and country. Harry came into my real sphere of interest once he'd married Meghan Markle. I've never watched Suits. I wasn't what you would call a fan of the show. Once again, she is another human being and I don't fangirl. When she started receiving such horrid press though, such cruel comments, when race started being pulled out - 'would Harry and Meghan's baby look like a monkey?' - I was appalled. I really stood up and noticed. When she was being called a narcissist, that she had seemingly weaved a spell over Harry and made him leave his family, 'it's all that woman's fault', I really paid attention - by the way, the 1950s called and wants people like you back. Then I watched as the documentary played on Netflix and I found them to be intelligent, caring, affected by what had happened, and very clearly in love with one another, their only ""crime"" was to say we want out of a toxic family. People came forward with praise and love for them, and not just in the documentary. They helped others. They stepped up when things got tough. I was now cheering for them to not sit down and shut up. Be louder, Harry and Meghan, I thought. And for all the gormless folk who trot out ""but they wanted to be private..."" Yes, they wanted to be left alone, they absolutely did. When that was not the case, they decided to set the record straight from 
their
 own perspective. Not loathsome people who whisper and horse-trade stories to get the press off their backs and onto someone else's - just like they did to Meghan. Not even Andrew and his abhorrent behaviour received the kind of vehemence Meghan did. 'Oh, It's Meghan's turn now to cop crap, said the powers that be. And Harry loves her? Well, it's his as well He should know his place, and she hers'. I'd rather tell my own story than someone else, thank you very much. I'd rather the Murdochracy not be allowed to ride their utter sh!tshow rubbish over the top of me, and that's what they have done. It's for them to tell their story and their truths. Not The Firm. Not the tabloids.The biggest mistake the British Royals have ever made is to let this pair be cast adrift, and it was very much to the benefit of some within this modern but still archaic family to shoo them away. I think history will show what a dim-witted thing this was to do.This audiobook was passionately and lovingly narrated by Harry. One would think this is something he had chosen as a career, narrator. His words, although I'm fairly certain were helped by his ghost writer, are still most definitely his, and are poetic and meaningful and not at all bitter or twisted like some of the Goodreads reviewers who rated this 1 star without reading it and out of pure hatred. How sad.I work with people day in and day out who have lived within toxic families, and do not make the mistake of thinking that the BRF is some god-blessed, sacrosanct family that cannot be toxic, because they jolly well are. Look at them and their behaviour.And last of all, I realise that Harry and Meghan also live a privileged lifestyle (albeit very tough at crucial times with no protection) all of these players do, they choose to do a lot of good work with theirs. Good for them. Oh, and to the person who complained about the amount Harry is giving to charity, a) you wouldn't know, and b) it's all relative. If you earn $700 a week, you aren't going to be donating $650 of that to charity. They also do a lot of other charitable works. If you are interested in this book, it's a good read. Compelling. Well written. The audio version is well narrated. If you aren't interested, if you hate them, and you are buying copies to burn, you're foolish for burning books and you are still giving them money, how silly. Maybe just keep walking and be invested in your own life or buy the books you like and actually read them. There is such a thing as choice and Harry and Meghan have made theirs.

Rating 4 out of 5,"4 Stars // The prince is laying bare.Growing up in Germany for most of my life, my interest in the Royal Family was close to zero when I decided to move to London in the summer of 2015. Calling England my new home from that point on, it slowly crept up on me under how much scrutiny the Royals were by the press almost every day. Rightfully so, I thought back then - living off of tax payer money and with no clear and practical use-case in modern times, I thought that this would just be the price one has to pay for living so royally privileged above the rest of the country. What we sometimes forget though is that no one deliberately chooses to be a highborn before being thrown into this world - we can't decide our fate beforehand - and as with any group of people, there will always be the black sheep, the misfits who would voluntarily have chosen a different, in this case a more mundane life. Enter Prince Harry.This book then - his memoir, HIS retelling of the years growing up under the Royal banner - too, was under a lot of scrutiny before release. As the British Press loves to do, Harry was heavily criticised for hiring a ghost-writer, for getting historical facts slightly wrong or for trying to dismantle the monarchy from its core. Arguably a huge factor in sales of the tabloid press is to squeeze as many clickbait-y and sales-driving articles out of the Royals as they can. It’s this weird relationship between those two parties in which the Royals have to keep the press at bay and yet let them come close enough to drip-feed them with information in order to maintain interest in them within the general public.In his memoir, Harry speaks of many instances from quite early on in which the British Media haunted him and his family to get these juice stories that drive readers. Ultimately it would be the constant obtrusion by journalists and their then often times racist take on Meghan Markle that would end up being the tipping point for the couple to leave the Royals, leave the UK and move to the US in order to find a more distanced, private live far away from the centre of attention of the tabloids. Having now read this book I will say that I had underestimated the amount of power and influence the Media could have on a persons private life and well-being. My take that this would just the price you pay for being born in wealth might have been fairly shortsighted, as it almost feels like the price outweighs the benefits in this case - Harrys mother Diana for example ultimately paid the highest price there is.And it’s clear that Dianas death left scars on Harry that have yet to fully heal. She’s the key element not only in this book, but in many decisions in his life. With her passing in 1997, Harry lost the motherly figure in his life very early on and having the Queen as his grandmother meant that this relationship was forced to adhere to a certain etiquette and thereby keeping a physical and emotional distance. Shockingly we learn, that Harry had never in his life hugged Queen Elisabeth - his own Grandma - due to the strict protocols surrounding her. Being born as the 2nd in line behind Prince William, the ‘spare’ as Charles jokingly calls Harry after birth, we learn of a child choked by the tight corset of the Monarchy with all its strict rules and traditions, without any motherly figure to cling on to and with being labeled off as ‘2nd class’ from the moment he took his first breath in this world. It’s easy to hate on Harry, to belittle all of this for all the wealth he therefor was born into, but it becomes quite clear throughout this book, that he would have rather chosen a more ordinary and mundane life in exchange for this ill fate of being a highborn. It’s a trade-off he despised more the older he got. What took me by surprise the most is the amount of details and juice insights that Harry reveals from his private life and Royal duties. Nobody forced him (I hope) to talk about his love for weed and video-games. About how he lost his virginity behind a Pub to an older lady. About how he battled with anxiety and panic attacks for years and about how the tried psychedelics as a form of self-therapy. About how he almost lost his Penis to frostbite, or was hunted by Taliban fighters with the mission to take his life. The Prince lays bare (quite literally) and this is ultimately what makes this book so entertaining and gripping. He lifts the dusty curtain of the Royal chambers and gives an insight into the inner workings of the Monarchy and for an outsider like me it were these parts which hooked me the most. Harry clearly uses this book as a form of therapy, as a cry for help, as a big finger in the face of all his haters, saying: Look, not everything is rosy behind the curtains - we, too, have our internal battles to fight.Of course this whole take relies on the premise that everything written in this book happened as described here. I’m sure it went through many hands, was read by many eyes of lawyers and gents before going into print - some people close to Harry, like his wife, might have edited some parts - we will never know. We also won’t ever hear King Charles’ or Prince Williams take on the events described in this book. So we sort of have to give Harry the benefit of the doubt that his retelling is honest. And fittingly: although not being written by himself, the books tone is casual and anything other than ‘classy’ - it’s sombre through most of it, getting emotional in its voice where it needs to be and due to its short chapter length quite a good paced read. It reads like a therapy session, because it probably is. In the end, I was positively surprised by the Princes memoirs. It lacked the ultimate message though, the last take-away from it all. I would have also wished for him to generally question the concept of the Royal family, for maybe criticising its history entangled in slavery and colonialism even more. But maybe this wasn’t the place for that. This book is indeed very personal and you have to have the balls (or in Harrys case: the Penis) to pull this kind of thing off. He comes across like a good bloke who many people did wrong - maybe that was his intention - but if you take what is written here with a tiny pinch of salt, what’s left is really quite an entertaining and thought-provoking book. Show more",4,4 Stars  The prince is laying bareGrowing up in Germany for most of my life my interest in the Royal Family was close to zero when I decided to move to London in the summer of 2015 Calling England my new home from that point on it slowly crept up on me under how much scrutiny the Royals were by the press almost every day Rightfully so I thought back then  living off of tax payer money and with no clear and practical usecase in modern times I thought that this would just be the price one has to pay for living so royally privileged above the rest of the country What we sometimes forget though is that no one deliberately chooses to be a highborn before being thrown into this world  we cant decide our fate beforehand  and as with any group of people there will always be the black sheep the misfits who would voluntarily have chosen a different in this case a more mundane life Enter Prince HarryThis book then  his memoir HIS retelling of the years growing up under the Royal banner  too was under a lot of scrutiny before release As the British Press loves to do Harry was heavily criticised for hiring a ghostwriter for getting historical facts slightly wrong or for trying to dismantle the monarchy from its core Arguably a huge factor in sales of the tabloid press is to squeeze as many clickbaity and salesdriving articles out of the Royals as they can Its this weird relationship between those two parties in which the Royals have to keep the press at bay and yet let them come close enough to dripfeed them with information in order to maintain interest in them within the general publicIn his memoir Harry speaks of many instances from quite early on in which the British Media haunted him and his family to get these juice stories that drive readers Ultimately it would be the constant obtrusion by journalists and their then often times racist take on Meghan Markle that would end up being the tipping point for the couple to leave the Royals leave the UK and move to the US in order to find a more distanced private live far away from the centre of attention of the tabloids Having now read this book I will say that I had underestimated the amount of power and influence the Media could have on a persons private life and wellbeing My take that this would just the price you pay for being born in wealth might have been fairly shortsighted as it almost feels like the price outweighs the benefits in this case  Harrys mother Diana for example ultimately paid the highest price there isAnd its clear that Dianas death left scars on Harry that have yet to fully heal Shes the key element not only in this book but in many decisions in his life With her passing in 1997 Harry lost the motherly figure in his life very early on and having the Queen as his grandmother meant that this relationship was forced to adhere to a certain etiquette and thereby keeping a physical and emotional distance Shockingly we learn that Harry had never in his life hugged Queen Elisabeth  his own Grandma  due to the strict protocols surrounding her Being born as the 2nd in line behind Prince William the spare as Charles jokingly calls Harry after birth we learn of a child choked by the tight corset of the Monarchy with all its strict rules and traditions without any motherly figure to cling on to and with being labeled off as 2nd class from the moment he took his first breath in this world Its easy to hate on Harry to belittle all of this for all the wealth he therefor was born into but it becomes quite clear throughout this book that he would have rather chosen a more ordinary and mundane life in exchange for this ill fate of being a highborn Its a tradeoff he despised more the older he got What took me by surprise the most is the amount of details and juice insights that Harry reveals from his private life and Royal duties Nobody forced him I hope to talk about his love for weed and videogames About how he lost his virginity behind a Pub to an older lady About how he battled with anxiety and panic attacks for years and about how the tried psychedelics as a form of selftherapy About how he almost lost his Penis to frostbite or was hunted by Taliban fighters with the mission to take his life The Prince lays bare quite literally and this is ultimately what makes this book so entertaining and gripping He lifts the dusty curtain of the Royal chambers and gives an insight into the inner workings of the Monarchy and for an outsider like me it were these parts which hooked me the most Harry clearly uses this book as a form of therapy as a cry for help as a big finger in the face of all his haters saying Look not everything is rosy behind the curtains  we too have our internal battles to fightOf course this whole take relies on the premise that everything written in this book happened as described here Im sure it went through many hands was read by many eyes of lawyers and gents before going into print  some people close to Harry like his wife might have edited some parts  we will never know We also wont ever hear King Charles or Prince Williams take on the events described in this book So we sort of have to give Harry the benefit of the doubt that his retelling is honest And fittingly although not being written by himself the books tone is casual and anything other than classy  its sombre through most of it getting emotional in its voice where it needs to be and due to its short chapter length quite a good paced read It reads like a therapy session because it probably is In the end I was positively surprised by the Princes memoirs It lacked the ultimate message though the last takeaway from it all I would have also wished for him to generally question the concept of the Royal family for maybe criticising its history entangled in slavery and colonialism even more But maybe this wasnt the place for that This book is indeed very personal and you have to have the balls or in Harrys case the Penis to pull this kind of thing off He comes across like a good bloke who many people did wrong  maybe that was his intention  but if you take what is written here with a tiny pinch of salt whats

Rating 4 out of 5,"For most of us, a real-life prince is akin to fiction, but this was real life for Prince Harry. Harry depicts the differing treatment between the heir and the spare. At its core, this is a cry for help against the horrors wrought by the paparazzi, which have upended Harry's life from the moment he was born. Their no holds barred attacks for any angle that will sell ultimately led to the death of his mother and bullied his choice of wife and her family to a disgusting degree. Some may feel that as a royal, he owes his face to the public, and the repercussions and scrutiny are bad, but the constant lies go unchallenged. What happened to honest journalism? There must be more done to protect against such heinous acts. Ramifications of this ""bad"" press can be seen with the public outcry against Harry, and this book before any of them even had a chance to read what was said. A lot of work has gone into fighting this in America from celebrities such as Jennifer Garner asking for protection and grace. Negotiations are often made to be left out of the media circus. Negotiations are often made to sell these photos to try to have some semblance of control over the barrage of cameras in the faces of normal life. However, there is still much work to be done.Mostly I feel bad for Harry. He was not set up to be successful in life on his own. He was not brought up to be anything but a backup plan for a monarchy that may no longer have a place in the country of their rule. He never had to worry about things like money. He was not set up with the skills to stand up for and fight for himself without express permission and written requests for anything he wanted to use his money on, as all expenditures are scrutinized (which is fine), but no one expected him to try to live on his own.My biggest confusion comes from Harry's mixed emotions regarding his family. He feels a deep sense of loyalty to them and predominantly had no issues with most immediate members of the family and Meghan. There is much alluding to a major disagreement with Kate. It could be easy to conclude that she poisoned William's mind against Meghan. Knowing the underlying issues here is hard without knowing the full story. I also wondered about other royals and advisors where code names were used. Personnel that leaked things to the press, which didn't always add up in terms of motive provided. I wanted more backstory to understand this. The fight was missing for me. There was a lot of playing a victim, and he even stated that afterward, multiple people asked him why he didn't go to them or talk to him. However, I do not 100% blame Harry for this. He never received the guidance needed to navigate the world as a functional adult. He spent his entire life on the outskirts, but he also had things taken care of for him, such as the security being on hand and people who would cater to much of his needs, he was not educated on how to be out in the world on his own. Harry has been hurting and dealing with emotional trauma for most of his life, but he has not had much success with therapy. But he uses a lot of this as an excuse, I am glad that Meghan called him on it and wouldn't accept to be treated in whatever way he lashed out at her with. It was with high emotion that Harry chose to depict William the way that he did, and it is interesting coming from a royal that knows the ramifications of this.I cannot even imagine (nor would I want to) the stress and anxiety of having to sprint through a grocery store and load up on clothes for half a year at end of day shopping times in an attempt to have a few moments in public without constant scrutiny. I do not think that the majority of people would be fully sane after constant endurance of that. The military sections were actually what I was most intrigued to read about, as I had read accounts from the Afghanis about how terrible they were. Much like the British media, this was also exaggerated, and for the most part, I didn't see any issues with what was said there, but I think it did show more of his true character. I was hurting for Harry with the wreath section and that even this was stripped from him to honor those who fought by his side. The main issues I see are from people who never had the honor to serve. However, there had to be SOME semblance of foresight into the reaction that such statements would be taken by the terrorists that can use that as additional fuel in their indoctrination against the West. I have read several reviews that poked holes into things said by Meghan that do not match up with things Harry has said here (such as the first time they met, etc.) It seems like a weird thing for one of them to change the narrative and call the credibility of one of the two into question.I am left with the knowledge that there are two sides to every story (not including the terrible paparazzi), and I wish there were a way to get a more comprehensive account of events from more than one side. It is weird to depict a particular person as having zero faults. Was it edited by her? Stubborn and petty seems to be the best way to describe the royal family, including Harry. If any of them had been less stubborn, this could have gone so many different ways that it would have been easier to repair as a family unit. But we all know the crown comes before anything else... It also seems weird to continue generating MORE press when he fights against it. Perhaps it is from the headspace of ""trying to control it."" I don't know. He mentions the need for money multiple times, and although he accounts for a generous charitable donation from the sales, a set amount was mentioned. So it's not purely altruistic. Which I am ok with, but not if it is led to believe that he didn't make any money off of it. Formatting-wise, I wondered if he was trying to plug into the feel of his mother's memoir: Diana: Her True Story--in Her Own Words, which was a compilation of phone calls, notes, and email messages that were compiled into a book and, at times were clipped and did not encompass a complete thought. **with each new edition being released, it appears that Harry is retracting and adding things in. So the petty continues as the credibility falls. I'm unsure which version I am on or how significant the changes are. Harry would be the happiest in Botswana, and hopefully, he can return to live there someday. I will give it a solid 3.5 Star rounded up because even though a bit slow in the beginning. The fascination with royals still exists, and I was entertained.Show more",4,For most of us a reallife prince is akin to fiction but this was real life for Prince Harry Harry depicts the differing

Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 stars Some things to know before I start my review: *I have ALWAYS been a huge fan and supporter of anything British, often saying that I was ""Born to be British,"" so the Royals have fallen into the category of things that I love.*I was a supporter of Meghan & Harry since their beginning, and already had nothing but sympathy and empathy for them and their situation. *I listened to the audiobook version, which was read by the author.I knew from the very first chapter, that this book was going to try it's best to break me. And there were times where I had to stop listening for days at a time, because the hate and subterfuge that these two went through, it was more than anyone should ever have to endure. Even if only a fraction of his words are true, that is too much. But I am taking his words as their truth, and to me, this is his interpretation of what really happened. I fully appreciate that he was willing to break protocall to set the record straight. Sure, it's something that has never been done and is frowned upon by his family, but evolution of people and processes are what allows for betterment of the world. And as long as no one else was even trying to put a stop to the hate or correct the lies, I feel like things would have only gotten worse for them, to the point that something unthinkable would have happened. Well, something even more unthinkable than everything that has already taken place.Partway through the book, I think somewhere around the 40% mark, I read an article on the book, an opinion piece. I read a few actually, but this one stood out. It wasn't bashing him or them, as most other articles were, but this made me think of things in a slightly different way. It basically said that leaving wasn't about Meghan, that Harry was already looking for a way out, and the situation (let's be real here, the attack on her) provided him with that motivation to make the break that he had always wanted (in my opinion, needed) to make. Source article: MSN.com written by Vicky Ward on 1/12/23 Reading this, it sort of bent how I was thinking of things. Don't get me wrong, I still 100% believe that these two were done dirty, and by not only the press, but by those closest to them, who were supposed to love and support them. But it also made me see that maybe Harry really never fit in with his family. And while that may be sad, it happens all the time. This time, he just happened to be born into a family that lived under the microscope, and seemed inescapable. I think that had I not read this article until after I was done with the book, I would have probably rounded up my 4.5 stars, as it would have read differently to me. I'm saddened to say this, but I feel like this book won't change anything. The people who are against these two who will read it, will only be looking to tear things apart. And everyone else reading it will have pretty much been on their side already, and like me, just want to fully, or at least further, understand what was happening. I just want to give them both a big hug. And I am just about as introverted and antisocial as one can get, yet I'd still hug them. To circle back to my intro statements, I still fully support H&M, and they have continue to have my sympathy. As someone who is also bi-racial and was in a bi-racial marriage, they also have my complete empathy, because people are mean enough, I cannot imagine going through the hate that I've seen personally, but on their global level. And even though Harry says it isn't racism from his family, the fact that they are being intentionally oblivious and ignorant of everything, it may be worse. As he was the one reading the audiobook, I could feel the hurt in his words, and it broke my heart. And seeing all that he has presented here, this book has made me reevaluate my love of all things British. While I still have an affinity for the land and atmosphere, there are very few royals that have my respect after this. And let's be honest, I'm still not entirely convinced that The Institution wasn't behind Princess Diana's death, so the things presented here [regarding H&M] not only make me lean heavily back in that direction, but also remove them from my ""favorite things"" list. I am quite honestly disgusted by Pa and Willy, as well as their wives. But the point of all of this was for Harry to tell his truth. To officially make a statement, that was attached to his name. Unlike everyone else who has ever been in his family, and hid behind ""Palace Sources,"" so I applaud him for this book, and the courage that it took to write and release it. I am proud of him, that he was able to own his faults, take accountability for the things that he did in his past, and then take the steps to correct things that needed to be fixed. I only wish that the people who needed to hear this information was receptive to it instead of seeing it only as a betrayal, to realize that perhaps there needs to be some personal reflection and accountability on their own end. I hope that H&M can find happiness in their new home, and hope that America will treat them better that England ever did.Show more",4,45 stars Some things to know before I start my review I have

Rating 5 out of 5," Dear Republic: please come as soon as you can, will you?I quite like Harry & Meghan. After the passing of the Queen, they are actually the only ones I truly like among the Royal Family (RF). I enjoyed reading “Harry’s truth” in this book, and sadly, I believe the great majority of the things he recounts. Good for him, for them both, they are together truly taking control of the narrative now, and that is healthy, freeing and mature. He is taking responsibility for his life, past, present and future, and his priority is his family (Meg and the kids), as it should be, and not the Royal Family any more. That he is being paid handsomely for doing it at the same time, with the documentaries, books, media businesses, etc, is something that I don’t begrudge him in the least: he has been forced to do it by the way he has been treated by the RF and the difficult situation they have put him in. I applaud him and Meg for their courage in setting clear boundaries, which is what has to be done in flagrant cases of abuse, which is exactly what they have been through (believe me, I am a psychologist, and I see abuse in all its ugly forms, sizes and shapes ). If you are clear about having the abuse stopping, in most cases the relationship sadly cannot be salvaged. And this has happened to hundreds of my clients, and even to myself with my own father. Safety is a priority. Very often in these cases, specially when dealing with narcissists, the relationship has to stop, at the bare minimum cool down and minimise, even if it breaks your heart, simply because you need to protect yourself from the damage that those toxic people inflict. What many people seem to be completely ignorant about is that “safety” does not only refer to “physical” security, but also “mental”, “emotional” “financial”, and “spiritual” safety, which they did not have in England. I have noted how the tabloid press have called Harry and Meghan narcissists in numerous occasions, when to me they were actually at the receiving end of much more narcissistic behaviour from Charles, Camilla, William, Kate, and high placed Machiavellian courtiers. They had to take extreme action to protect themselves as no one else would move a finger to protect them. Trying to become your own person in the “fishbowl” that Harry talks about, seems to me like an almost impossible task. He describes it very well, saying that he had been forcefully infantilised is own life, and then abruptly cut off completely.I basically think the rest of the main players in the RF are complete morons, and they truly deserve this book. Charles, William and the whole sorry, whining, undeserving lot, have only themselves to blame that this book exists at all. If they had treated Harry and specially Meghan with any decency, let alone understanding and compassion, instead of pettiness and jealousy, I’d be happy to bet this book would never had seen the light of day. Did it really never occurred to “the palace” that banishing these pair de facto, by imposing such harsh conditions on them like removing their security and cutting them off financially practically at a moment’s notice (reneging on the previous agreement of a year’s grace period to sort out their lives) would have some extreme consequences? I think that the RF were actually bluffing, attempting to blackmail them into coming back reluctantly as beggars. The palace advisors must be very sorry they played it so badly that it massively backfired. We’ll, tough! Here you have one of the consequences of behaving so appallingly to H&M!!!!! These two have triumphed without any more royal help. They can clearly make it on their own, and to me there is a strong argument for seeing this book as Charles and William’s doing.A lot of opprobrium has been flung at H&M precisely because of this book (on top of the incomprehensible and unprecedented previous hatred the tabloid press has stirred about them, wholly undeservedly), but I propose that a lot more people (only perhaps a lot less vocal than Piers Morgan, Jeremy Clarkson and their hideous right wing mates) actually love these two a lot more than they love the RF (sans The Queen), and they are truly happy for them finding peace and lucrative contracts in America. At the same time, Lady Susan Hussey makes a highly publicised race faux pa and Camilla wines and dines Morgan and Clarkson. . . Only with that, I think I could say “I rest my case” I already believed, before reading the book, that meek Charles, horrid Camilla, whiny William and his stuck-up wife, together with high courtiers and manipulators, all treated H&M abominably.

Rating 3 out of 5,"I’ve never really closely followed the royal family unless something major was happening - I don’t have the undeniable intrigue into their lives like many others do. I do love reading biographies and knew that Prince Harry has led an interesting life which is why I chose to read it. I have a lot of thoughts but I’d say the book was a solid 3.5 read. My review is TLDR: intriguing but nothing majorly new that I didn’t know. Writing was okay but clearly not written entirely by him hence the voice/style differers in chapters. My takeaways:1. The paparazzi is absolutely out of control. Hard to believe in the time of social media (more so during Harry/Meghan’s era than Diana) that there would still be so much im of a threat from them. Maybe that’s the ignorance of a non-famous person. But I do agree that their bombardment of Diana led to her death. They treated Meghan Markle horribly, that much was clear prior to me reading the book. 2. Only someone in the royal family understands it’s dynamics. I couldn’t possibly even begin to fathom the money, luxury, or rules that they are held to - yet clearly there is a lot of leading on of the press with planted stories. They can’t 100% blame the paparazzi if they’re feeding them content. To that extent, it doesn’t seem like it’s possible to keep secrets in the family. 3. Harry’s lumping of of journalists in with the paps and other sleazy tabloids bothered me as a journalist. Granted I do not have anything to do with writing about celebrities usually, but I don’t think that in the case of tabloids you can even call these reporters “journalists.” This mixture of references bothered me but that’s a personal thing. 4. Losing Diana fucked up Harry and William’s already difficult (or different) childhood. I never knew (this is a minor spoiler) that Harry believed Diana would still be alive. It’s clear that her loss haunts him to this day. Her loss was with him in every thing he did and does. And the way her death was handled by the RF is clearly a contributing factor to his bumpy path.5. Running away to Africa multiple times seems to be one of Harry’s coping methods. Must be nice to be rich. Now I’ll give it to him he has clearly a heart for conservation and for military appreciation. He needed therapy SO MUCH EARLIER than he got it. That’s a fault of the RF for sure. Who was looking out for Harry? Sure, his body guard(s), but what about his mental health. 6. Less droning on about the military would’ve been my preference. I had to skim a lot of the technical parts because I didn’t care and didn’t understand. And like, where were all the pictures! Maybe he wanted to keep some of his personal snaps private but I think that a little less content (407 pages is looong) and more photos would’ve been a nice addition. 7. The end didn’t surprise me because obviously it’s real life so we all know what happens - but I think that I didn’t get a real feel on WHY the RF really rejected and was mean to Meghan. I know it’s just Harry’s side of things but I can’t imagine she really did anything so nasty that they deserved getting out of royal life. I think it’s clear Harry’s relationship with Charles (and Camilla) was tenuous at best, which that combined with losing Diana ended up never really cementing a strong relationship between him and William. (And also Kate/William should’ve known better about the Nazi costume Harry wore so I think they should’ve been blamed). 8. The writing. The prologue was so bumpy for me, I’m like is this a rough draft? In fact, a lot of chapters I felt like the writing was very choppy. I presume there was at least one ghostwriter if not more and that’s why the tones and writing styles vary during the book. It felt like different writers while I was reading but I’m not sure that’s something that every reader will pick up. It didn’t make it unreadable but slightly less enjoyable. J don’t know if the publishing house wanted it rushed out and didn’t care that the writing wasn’t super solid and finalized, or that’s just what you get from a “bombshell” celebrity memoir. Clearly the publishers benefited and Harry benefited in two ways. First, he gets money their family clearly needed after being cut off. And second, he got to say whatever he wanted and the RF can’t respond.

Rating 3 out of 5,"I'm going to come right out and say it: we don't really know what's true. There are a lot of facts, a lot of conversations, that different members of the royal family remember differently. And as a former criminal defense attorney, that doesn't really surprise me. Memory is really elastic, and two people who experienced the same conversation can remember it very differently and both be absolutely convinced they are telling the truth. So I won't speculate on whose version is ""more accurate"" (and quite frankly, I can't very well speak ill of the British monarchy - as an American, I live in the UK at His Majesty's pleasure, and would very much like to continue doing so, so God save the king etc.).That said - if it's true that Charles once really told Harry the monarchy couldn't afford to support Meghan Markle financially, along with Harry, William, and Kate, and that she needed to get a job and support herself - that's hilarious. I mean, it's hilarious because it's so obviously untrue. And while a lot of people may be nonetheless inclined to say, ""Well, yeah, everybody else needs to work to live, why should MM be any different just because she married a prince?"" But the reality is- she HAD a job, a very successful one, and the monarchy required her to give that career up, so it isn't really that simple. Honestly, it's an interesting book underneath the family bickering and the entitlement (I'll circle back on this later - I don't think Harry is a bad person, but you can't avoid the fact that he is, absolutely, very entitled) because it really does give a new understanding of how toxic it can be to grow up in the limelight, just like with child stars. Harry desperately wants to access normal reality, but he clearly has no idea how to. (Side comment: it's really bizarre to me that he had never been to Paris until he was 21 years old. Not only did his mother famously die there, but it's only a 3 hour train ride from London. And the royals seem to travel quite a bit. It's almost unbelievable to me that he had never been there). I should warn you, amidst all the family drama (and a vivid description of his, and I quote, ""frostbitten todger"" - which, I hope someone remixes the audiobook of that chapter and makes it a banger of a song because it's so absurd) and the Meghan Markle tidbits, there is a huge third of the book dedicated to his military service, and it was really boring, and really weird, and he seems way too excited about it. Back to the royal family drama (that's what we're all here for, isn't it?). There's this one scene that really stuck with me. He goes to ask his grandmother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, for permission to marry Meghan Markle. The conversation went like this:E: You have to ask my permission?H: Well, yes. Your staff told me as much.E: Well, if you HAVE to, I suppose I HAVE to say yes.Understandably, Harry's left standing there absolutely bewildered. Is she being sarcastic? Is she engaging in wordplay? Is she saying she is giving permission, or she isn't? He waits for her to say something else, to give him some sign of what she means, but she says nothing. Just stares at her grandson. He decided that meant she had given her permission, shrugged it off, and said ""Thank you."" He wanted to hug her, but felt he shouldn't. Felt he couldn't. Like, goddamn. Again, I'll revisit the fact that people can remember conversations in very different ways, but... man. What a conversation to have with your grandmother, when you're asking her permission to marry the girl you love. What an unbelievably disturbing family dynamic. If Harry's a little messed up, I can't very well blame him. That just suggests such a culture of coolness and head games and, honestly, contempt. It's hard not to read some contempt in that conversation. Certainly the most likeable part of Harry is his love for Meghan. That's completely apparent - their love is truly wonderful and runs very deep and is rooted in communication and unconditional support. And that love changes him for the better, quite clearly. Harry is a meathead, but he means well; his heart's in the right place. And we love a character arc.

Rating 1 out of 5,"Oh Harry. I bought this book. I wanted to like it, but sadly, I did not.Reading the reviews, I get the sense this memoir is polarizing. Apparently, some people felt Harry’s take was emotional and genuine. I fall into the category that found his narrative petty and immature.First, I couldn’t tolerate the writing. This read like Harry provided his ghostwriter jot notes from his diary, supplemented with thoughts and conversations he has with himself in his head (with unnecessary information added in parentheses).Second, to any mental health professional, within the first few pages, it’s blatantly obvious that Harry has unresolved trauma from Princess Diana’s death. The narcissistic/borderline personality traits are written all over this book. Harry’s inadequate sense of self as clearly demonstrated by his repeated mentions of being the “spare” to William’s “heir”, the preoccupation with success/beauty/ideal love, the “red mist” he seems to think is something to be proud of when it’s really uncontrolled rage and an inability to regulate his anger, the impulsivity and maladaptive coping with substance use to numb and repress his emotions, idealizing/devaluing people - the list goes on. For someone who supposedly advocates for mental health, I found his stories devaluing of psychiatry. To Harry’s credit, he went back to therapy with Meghan’s prompting. On the other hand, when his therapist speculated that part of him might still be trapped in August 1997 when his mom died, his initial reaction was thinking it was a bit “rude” to be called a child. Harold. Really? Does someone have to spell out to you that repressing your trauma by not crying for 20 years, drinking and partying, and being immature and entitled basically screams that you perpetually act like you’re still 12? Also, the unsolicited stories about Harry’s penis. I didn’t ask or need to know about any of them.Third, the glorification of the military and colonialism. I had such a hard time reading these chapters.There were moments where I felt empathy for Harry and Meghan, and I have no love for the paparazzi and do not condone any of the privacy violations or stalking. But, “never complain, never explain”. And your reaction to Willy and Pa calling you delusional is calling them delusional?! Real mature. Seriously, Harry. By writing all of this, I feel it made it worse! How credible of a historian do you think you are when you write things like “I can’t recall”, and then flip flop on your timelines and then insinuate you were drinking too much to remember clearly?! Harold!Okay, it was all so petty. Sonya had to endure me clutching my hair in disbelief at all the fake humility, entitlement, and immaturity. If Harry was truly repentant, I would imagine he would have learned from his prior mistakes rather than double down on the misogyny and continue to externalize any blame. Harry was allegedly “prohibited” from learning independence, so instead of taking his education seriously and becoming an adult, it sounds like he lived like a frat boy, played XBox, learned to sail/fire rifles/ski, fly to Botswana whenever he liked, and not have to take any accountability because the Palace took care of things for him? Something doesn’t totally add up here.I feel like this book was educational from a cognitive behavioural therapy standpoint, where there are plenty of examples of cognitive distortions like personalization, all or nothing thinking, overgeneralization, catastrophization, mind reading, emotional reasoning and mental filtering. We know, your Mummy died in a tunnel chased by the paps, and now you have crippling anxiety from unresolved trauma. Does that mean it’ll happen to you? Did you just read Willy’s mind? How exactly did you jump to that conclusion Harold? Now, I’m writing like Prince Harry’s ghostwriter, so I think it’s time to end this review.I don’t regret reading it, but oh dear.This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review",1,Oh Harry I bought this book I wanted to like it but sadly I did notReading the reviews I get the sense this memoir is polarizing Apparently some people felt Harrys take was emotional and genuine I fall into the category that found his narrative petty and immatureFirst I couldnt tolerate the writing This read like Harry provided his ghostwriter jot notes from his diary supplemented with thoughts and conversations he has with himself in his head with unnecessary information added in parenthesesSecond to any mental health professional within the first few pages its blatantly obvious that Harry has unresolved trauma from Princess Dianas death The narcissisticborderline personality traits are written all over this book Harrys inadequate sense of self as clearly demonstrated by his repeated mentions of being the spare to Williams heir the preoccupation with successbeautyideal love the red mist he seems to think is something to be proud of when its really uncontrolled rage and an inability to regulate his anger the impulsivity and maladaptive coping with substance use to numb and repress his emotions idealizingdevaluing people  the list goes on For someone who supposedly advocates for mental health I found his stories devaluing of psychiatry To Harrys credit he went back to therapy with Meghans prompting On the other hand when his therapist speculated that part of him might still be trapped in August 1997 when his mom died his initial reaction was thinking it was a bit rude to be called a child Harold Really Does someone have to spell out to you that repressing your trauma by not crying for 20 years drinking and partying and being immature and entitled basically screams that you perpetually act like youre still 12 Also the unsolicited stories about Harrys penis I didnt ask or need to know about any of themThird the glorification of the military and colonialism I had such a hard time reading these chaptersThere were moments where I felt empathy for Harry and Meghan and I have no love for the paparazzi and do not condone any of the privacy violations or stalking But never complain never explain And your reaction to Willy and Pa calling you delusional is calling them delusional Real mature Seriously Harry By writing all of this I feel it made it worse How credible of a historian do you think you are when you write things like I cant recall and then flip flop on your timelines and then insinuate you were drinking too much to remember clearly HaroldOkay it was all so petty Sonya had to endure me clutching my hair in disbelief at all the fake humility entitlement and immaturity If Harry was truly repentant I would imagine he would have learned from his prior mistakes rather than double down on the misogyny and continue to externalize any blame Harry was allegedly prohibited from learning independence so instead of taking his education seriously and becoming an adult it sounds like he lived like a frat boy played XBox learned to sailfire riflesski fly to Botswana whenever he liked and not have to take any accountability because the Palace took care of things for him Something doesnt totally add up hereI feel like this book was educational from a cognitive behavioural therapy standpoint where there are plenty of examples of cognitive distortions like personalization all or nothing thinking overgeneralization catastrophization mind reading emotional reasoning and mental filtering We know your Mummy died in a tunnel chased by the paps and now you have crippling anxiety from unresolved trauma Does that mean itll happen to you Did you just read Willys mind How exactly did you jump to that conclusion Harold Now Im writing like Prince Harrys ghostwriter so I think its time to end this reviewI dont regret reading it but oh dearThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilersShow full review
Rating 4 out of 5,"Since everybody and their dog Spot is reading Spare, I won't give a lengthy review of it. Instead, I'll just jot down some thoughts I had about it, in no order of importance:1. Listen to Spare on audiobook if you can, like I did. I had a better appreciation for it hearing Prince Harry read it for himself. He sounds natural, and hearing him narrate his own story makes him able to connect with listeners/readers better.2. Lest anyone think this book is a hit piece on the monarchy or his family, please remember that the Royals have a history of writing and publishing intensely personal family details. During her reign, Queen Victoria published a highly successful book about her family's many trips to Balmoral.3. Prince Harry goes by lots of different names. It's interesting.4. Harry seems to have a loving, affectionate relationship with his father. I love that King Charles refers to his sons as Darling Boy and that they call him Pa. It's really sweet.5. The first 2/3 of this book are a bit of a slog, covering Harry's boyhood through his singlehood, mostly focusing on his years of military service. He's proud and passionate about his time in the military, going so far as to support wounded vets through the Invictus Games and beyond. But's it's also clear that he suffered from PTSD. He was given no special treatment in the military, and other than his wife and children it's the one area of his life his fiercely loyal to.6. Dude has a penchant for over-sharing. A significant portion of Spare is devoted to Harry going on and on about his penis and the Seinfeldesque situations he and his member found themselves in. It's not erotic or comical, just odd. 7. The British press can suck it. They truly are awful. Americans love dirt on celebrities too, but I think we grant them a little more space and courtesy than the Brits do. It's a wonder Harry and Meghan and the rest of the Royal Family aren't all insane by now.8. It's really a shame that Harry and Meghan and William and Kate couldn't truly become the Fantastic Four as they and so many other assumed they would be. All the components were there, and I believe they each made a real go of it, but they let the press, miscommunications, pride, childishness and the crown come between them. Perhaps things will change as they all get older, but right now I doubt it. 9. I don't doubt anything Prince Harry wrote in this book. Yes, I believe his brother bullied and assaulted him two years ago. Yes, I believe Queen Elizabeth's and (then) Prince Charles's staffers schemed and made decisions without their knowing. Yes, I believe the family could have backed him and Meghan more. Yes, the monarchy is quite problematic and costly, but it also generates revenue for the UK and does great humanitarian work. There are complicated ties here that simply cannot be undone easily.10. These people may be rich but not as rich as we think.11. Meghan grossly underestimated what her job as Harry's wife would be. In fact, I doubt she ever thought of it as a job, but it most certainly is. And the imbalance between the way the crown treated William and Kate as opposed to Harry and Meghan is apparent.12. Heredity monarchy is as much a villain of Spare as the press. William's smugness and bullying are off the chains. Yet he and Charles point out that Harry misconstrues lots of things.13. The structure of this book works against it. Many chapters only last a page or two and sound more like journal entries than well-crafted prose. He needed a better editor.14. I couldn't help noticing parallels between Prince Harry and Hunter Biden. Check out his book too on audio too if you get a chance. 15. Bottom line, I had the same reaction to Spare as I did watching Tiger King during the first week of lockdown in March 2020 (hey, I thought the world was going to end, okay?). Everyone is right to a certain degree, everyone is wrong to a certain degree, and the whole thing is a big old mess.Show more",4,Since everybody and their dog Spot is reading Spare I wont give a lengthy review of it Instead Ill just jot down some thoughts I had about it in no order of importance1 Listen to Spare on audiobook if you can like I did I had a better appreciation for it hearing Prince Harry read it for himself He sounds natural and hearing him narrate his own story makes him able to connect with listenersreaders better2 Lest anyone think this book is a hit piece on the monarchy or his family please remember that the Royals have a history of writing and publishing intensely personal family details During her reign Queen Victoria published a highly successful book about her familys many trips to Balmoral3 Prince Harry goes by lots of different names Its interesting4 Harry seems to have a loving affectionate relationship with his father I love that King Charles refers to his sons as Darling Boy and that they call him Pa Its really sweet5 The first 23 of this book are a bit of a slog covering Harrys boyhood through his singlehood mostly focusing on his years of military service Hes proud and passionate about his time in the military going so far as to support wounded vets through the Invictus Games and beyond Buts its also clear that he suffered from PTSD He was given no special treatment in the military and other than his wife and children its the one area of his life his fiercely loyal to6 Dude has a penchant for oversharing A significant portion of Spare is devoted to Harry going on and on about his penis and the Seinfeldesque situations he and his member found themselves in Its not erotic or comical just odd 7 The British press can suck it They truly are awful Americans love dirt on celebrities too but I think we grant them a little more space and courtesy than the Brits do Its a wonder Harry and Meghan and the rest of the Royal Family arent all insane by now8 Its really a shame that Harry and Meghan and William and Kate couldnt truly become the Fantastic Four as they and so many other assumed they would be All the components were there and I believe they each made a real go of it but they let the press miscommunications pride childishness and the crown come between them Perhaps things will change as they all get older but right now I doubt it 9 I dont doubt anything Prince Harry wrote in this book Yes I believe his brother bullied and assaulted him two years ago Yes I believe Queen Elizabeths and then Prince Charless staffers schemed and made decisions without their knowing Yes I believe the family could have backed him and Meghan more Yes the monarchy is quite problematic and costly but it also generates revenue for the UK and does great humanitarian work There are complicated ties here that simply cannot be undone easily10 These people may be rich but not as rich as we think11 Meghan grossly underestimated what her job as Harrys wife would be In fact I doubt she ever thought of it as a job but it most certainly is And the imbalance between the way the crown treated William and Kate as opposed to Harry and Meghan is apparent12 Heredity monarchy is as much a villain of Spare as the press Williams smugness and bullying are off the chains Yet he and Charles point out that Harry misconstrues lots of things13 The structure of this book works against it Many chapters only last a page or two and sound more like journal entries than wellcrafted prose He needed a better editor14 I couldnt help noticing parallels between Prince Harry and Hunter Biden Check out his book too on audio too if you get a chance 15 Bottom line I had the same reaction to Spare as I did watching Tiger King during the first week of lockdown in March 2020 hey I thought the world was going to end okay Everyone is right to a certain degree everyone is wrong to a certain degree and the whole thing is a big old messShow more
Rating 2 out of 5,"My rating for this book is based solely on writing and not on my opinion of Harry and Meghan as a person. My review though will be of my impressions on some of the content and the writing. Writing:I found it odd that it was stated explicitly in the beginning that Harry’s memory works by remembering rooms and not quotes, dates, etc. yet chose the writing style they did. And by this I mean a lot of the book has Harry quoting various family members, a large amount of scenes in the book are told by Harry as if in present tense, and everything recalled is extremely skewed in his favor. By claiming at the beginning that his memory doesn’t work that way and then spend the entire book relating information in that manner it made the material hard for me to personally trust the legitimacy of the material.Accuracy:There have been 4 factual errors that could have been EASILY caught by an editor that were allowed to stay in the final book. Also in general if someone is explains an argument or any sort of conflict to me and it is heavily biased without trying to see the other persons side I tend to not believe it (at least till I hear more context). It is rare that it is entirely one sides fault and rare that in someway you didn’t accidentally contribute to the conflict.Also family dynamics are very complicated and complex and with a story where not much context is given it makes me hard to agree with the inclusions he chose to share. Content:A bit too… personal (why did his editors not convince him to remove these sections) on subject that didn’t require explicit knowledge.I know entirely too much information about Harry’s “todger” and the language used at times was a bit cringey and Freudian (this section FOR SURE should not have made final print). Because the book was very biased it made me find a lot of inclusions problematic (and a bit hypocritical) such as:-trying to bait his security into fighting him when he is upset (this scene provides a lot of context why Harry did this so you as the reader can understand where he was coming from) while leaving out a lot of context in the infamous fight with William -when his mom’s butler wrote a tell all book and when Meghan’s dad leaked things to the press as being betraying, harmful, and hurtful when he was paid millions to write a book that does the same to his family (and I am merely saying how it was written felt hypocritical)-his view on the media: this book gave me an impression that if media coverage is positive and complimentary it is good and if it is critical or paints him negatively it is “bad”Memoir:Personally I am a fan of memoirs that serve as a thoughtful reflection on the highs and lows of one’s life (loved Michelle Obama’s and Tom Felton’s for this) and Spare at times felt like Harry had kept a journal of every slight someone gave him. Making his reflections seem a bit petty and entitled (not necessarily calling him either, just implying that the words used in the memoir gave me this vibe).Prose:Quite often the prose in the book was very purple. In general overly descriptive books (even in fiction books) tend to get on my nerve. And having watched the documentary and seen interviews this made it hard to connect the writing to the person (as the flowery type language used to describe everything in the book is non-existent in how he talks while being interviewed). Positive aspects of the story:It is clear he was deeply traumatized early in life by the death of his mother and the paparazzi, so for him to talk about this in a very open and vulnerable was nice to read.And he speaks about his wife very affectionately and respectfully, which in general it something I respect.Overall:Personally I think the book needed to be edited and the language and style it was told in was a disservice to the book as whole.This book while being a bit “explosive” at times really left me wanting more context.While I appreciate that he wanted to share his story and be vulnerable, I feel like the manner it was told was not very complimentary (showing a lack of reflection, accountability, empathy, and a bit entitled).My intention is not to write a review that bashes the subject (especially when a memoir is about someone sharing their life story) but merely how I perceived some of the content in the book.

Rating 5 out of 5,"This is a controversial book for many because they are on either Team Harry or Team William. I am on Team Royal Family and lets keep the Monarchy going with modern updates. I have been reading books about the Royal family since my first trip to Britain when I was 9 years old. I have read historical biographies by William Shawcross and popular biographies by ANdrew Morton. Next up I am going to read a book about the Duke of Kent that I found in Edinburgh. So in reading Spare I am not jumping on the news cycle bandwagon, I love the Royal family and I read about them frequently. I tried to look at this book from the perspective of how it adds to information known about the Royal Family. And there is a lot of information. It is a memoir and it represents Harry's view of his own situation. And in the Queen's words after the Oprah interview, recollections may differ. Clearly Harry was traumatized by his mother's death, and it has taken a long time for him to work through that. Clearly Meghan was treated in a racist manner by the British press, causing more trauma. In fact, the British press seems to have traumatized Harry throughout his life and his anger and animosity toward the press comes through loud and clear in this book. Harry tells the story of his family from his perspective and says at the outset he wrote the book to explain to his father and brother why he left the UK. And explain he does although if he seeks reconciliation as he claims to, perhaps publishing the book might not have been the best method. Maybe he could have just written it and given it to them. This book is Harry's story and the book needs to be judged by that marker. He talks about all this trauma andt growing up royal and living as a member of the family. He provides information I have never seen in royal publications such as how the rooms in Balmoral are decorated, how the family lives its life through the seasons, including hunting trips. Harry's stint in the Army shaped him into adulthood, demonstrating a side of life far from the privileged palace and boarding schools he grew up in--his love for the Army and comradeship with his fellow officers is clear and this is one of the best parts of the book, and the charities such as the Invictus games created because of his time in the Army provide true meaning for him. The story of meeting Meghan, getting married, and then leaving the royal job was similar to what was in the Netflix documentary. The salacious details leaked before publication (Harry losing his virginity, for example) are not so salacious in context. His father King Charles comes off better than expected (he calls Harry Darling Boy and tells him not to read the papers--good advice that if followed might have avoided so much heartbreak) and the parts about Camilla earlier in the book are countered later with good comments. There are several places where some things are wrong--he heard that his grandmother died when he was on a ski trip and not at Eton--which leads one to wonder what else is wrong in the book but again--it is the author's recollection. The portrayal of a bad relationship with William based on Harry's status as the Spare to William's status as heir seems difficult to square with the stories and pictures we have seen for all their lives, and even examples such as that William wouldn't talk to him at school are just sibling dynamics. Other examples of texting, living together, hanging out together indicate they were friendly in the past. It bothers me that Meghan and Harry have monetized their lives and though they claim to crave privacy they have revealed so much about their lives on Netflix and in this book. On the other hand they do have to pay for security and they receive no funds from Britain so making money is necessary. Maybe what bothers me most is that there is little personal responsibility taken for anything that happened - and honestly there are two sides to every story. I just hope that the book and the Netflix show have allowed Harry to earn sufficient funds and to get his story out so that now he doesn't need to say anything else and he and his family can reconcile while he and Meghan continue with the charitable work they do. It seems hard to imagine given what has been revealed, and how his family could trust Harry not to reveal private conversations as he has done so in the book. It will be hard if Harry doesn’t take responsibility for his own actions. it would be nice if the option where the Sussexes would be part in and part out could be considered. I would like to see the brothers reconciled and as a parent my heart aches for Charles. It would be nice if Harry could be a bit more like the original spare in Charles’s life, Princess Anne, who doesn’t care what the press says and just does her jobShow more",5,This is a controversial book for many because they are on either Team Harry or Team William I am on Team Royal Family and lets keep the Monarchy going with modern updates I have been reading books about the Royal family since my first trip to Britain when I was 9 years old I have read historical biographies by William Shawcross and popular biographies by ANdrew Morton Next up I am going to read a book about the Duke of Kent that I found in Edinburgh So in reading Spare I am not jumping on the news cycle bandwagon I love the Royal family and I read about them frequently I tried to look at this book from the perspective of how it adds to information known about the Royal Family And there is a lot of information It is a memoir and it represents Harrys view of his own situation And in the Queens words after the Oprah interview recollections may differ Clearly Harry was traumatized by his mothers death and it has taken a long time for him to work through that Clearly Meghan was treated in a racist manner by the British press causing more trauma In fact the British press seems to have traumatized Harry throughout his life and his anger and animosity toward the press comes through loud and clear in this book Harry tells the story of his family from his perspective and says at the outset he wrote the book to explain to his father and brother why he left the UK And explain he does although if he seeks reconciliation as he claims to perhaps publishing the book might not have been the best method Maybe he could have just written it and given it to them This book is Harrys story and the book needs to be judged by that marker He talks about all this trauma andt growing up royal and living as a member of the family He provides information I have never seen in royal publications such as how the rooms in Balmoral are decorated how the family lives its life through the seasons including hunting trips Harrys stint in the Army shaped him into adulthood demonstrating a side of life far from the privileged palace and boarding schools he grew up inhis love for the Army and comradeship with his fellow officers is clear and this is one of the best parts of the book and the charities such as the Invictus games created because of his time in the Army provide true meaning for him The story of meeting Meghan getting married and then leaving the royal job was similar to what was in the Netflix documentary The salacious details leaked before publication Harry losing his virginity for example are not so salacious in context His father King Charles comes off better than expected he calls Harry Darling Boy and tells him not to read the papersgood advice that if followed might have avoided so much heartbreak and the parts about Camilla earlier in the book are countered later with good comments There are several places where some things are wronghe heard that his grandmother died when he was on a ski trip and not at Etonwhich leads one to wonder what else is wrong in the book but againit is the authors recollection The portrayal of a bad relationship with William based on Harrys status as the Spare to Williams status as heir seems difficult to square with the stories and pictures we have seen for all their lives and even examples such as that William wouldnt talk to him at school are just sibling dynamics Other examples of texting living together hanging out together indicate they were friendly in the past It bothers me that Meghan and Harry have monetized their lives and though they claim to crave privacy they have revealed so much about their lives on Netflix and in this book On the other hand they do have to pay for security and they receive no funds from Britain so making money is necessary Maybe what bothers me most is that there is little personal responsibility taken for anything that happened  and honestly there are two sides to every story I just hope that the book and the Netflix show have allowed Harry to earn sufficient funds and to get his story out so that now he doesnt need to say anything else and he and his family can reconcile while he and Meghan continue with the charitable work they do It seems hard to imagine given what has been revealed and how his family could trust Harry not to reveal private conversations as he has done so in the book It will be hard if Harry doesnt take responsibility for his own actions it would be nice if the option where the Sussexes would be part in and part out could be considered I would like to see the brothers reconciled and as a parent my heart aches for Charles It would be nice if Harry could be a bit more like the original spare in Charless life Princess Anne who doesnt care what the press says and just does her jobShow more
Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 ⭐️What to say about this book, about which much has been said, and is only half the story?I think one of the interesting things I found while listening to this is how much of who & how I am mattered in how I processed this book.For instance, early on Harry tells us he’s an unreliable narrator. That his memory works best when remembering the physical details of the room in which things happen; he’s not great at the rest. I get we don’t all remember exact dates, or quotes. But in order for you to have a side in an argument, the sequence of events DOES matter. Was it you who first did A, prompting your brother , or sister-in-law, or father to react in way B? Or did what they did provoke your reaction? It matters. And as someone with a notable memory, it undercuts everything Harry says in this 15+ hour-long tale to start with this disclaimer. At least, for me.Another bias I brought to this is being the eldest sibling in my family. So much - SO MUCH - of what Harry complains about comes across as spoiled, lazy, younger sibling whining. You still officially live with Pa in your late 20s? You haven’t been home for a decade - why are you surprised by this? Your apartment in KP isn’t that grand? Ask for another one. Your digs at Nott Cott aren’t as smartly appointed as Willy & Kate’s? Go buy a couch. Or raid the dozen palaces, hundreds of rooms, apartments, & cottages, for some of the thousands of pieces of furniture available to you. Stop complaining about that. (And most of what you complain about.)Harry also fails to make the connection between the way the press hounds him, and the way he hunts the Taliban in Afghanistan. He literally uses some of the same language. While I understand the difference between harassing royals and fighting an enemy on the battlefield, I was left wondering if Harry fully does. As a sibling to a person who served in Afghanistan, I do think Harry speaks a little cavalierly about this experience. Not because of anything the British press says about that. But because of what Harry said right here - after the opportunity for years of reflection on this time in his life. Speaking of his time in the military…Harry is prescient enough to understand that he has PTSD - and it extends back to his mother’s death. That’s a completely fair assessment. Good for him for recognizing that. Now, own it. Because a part of PTSD is paranoia and a tendency toward conspiracy theories. And while Harry has some reason to suspect some people around him (more on that soon), he definitely comes across as paranoid a lot. He doesn’t say if he’s continuing therapy in America. But I really hope he is. He has much to unpack. And he seems to have reaped some of the benefits of feeling his feelings, instead of just numbing himself for decades.As for who is a source of some actual distrust in his life…It sounds like it’s Camilla.It sounds like he is laying the blame at Camilla’s feet for much of the leaked/false press, and at his father’s for not checking Camilla.In his lifetime of watching his family’s machinations, this is likely a fair assessment on his part.Here’s the part I think he misses:Charles loves Camilla. He always has.Harry acknowledges that here.But in his recent interviews, he all but says he & Meghan are the only ones in the family in love with each other - everyone else is just doing their duty.That is completely wrong - very offensive to everyone else in his family - and the exact opposite of what he says here, implicitly and explicitly. But I think he misses the implicit effects of this.For example:Both Charles & Harry put the women they love on a pedestal. So Harry wants to attack ANYONE & EVERYONE who says ANYTHING incorrect about Meghan.It starts with a short story about her having dated a hockey player. The story doesn’t say she is STILL dating him, thus cheating on Harry. Just that she did. She didn’t- he dated her friend.Harry wants the palace to issue a statement about that.They shrug it off.As they do a bunch of other silly kerfuffles like this.But Harry is angry each time - he sees them as sleights (some perpetrated by Camilla & her team) rather than an unwillingness to swat flies while you’re outside.If any of them are instigated by Camilla, then Charles is not going to do anything about them that makes his wife look bad. He is going to stand by her - he loves her - she is his wife. Just as Harry feels for Meghan.By the time Harry & Meghan really need their support - when the palace should be decrying the racism & death threats - it seems that everyone is exhausted by it all, and tired of Harry complaining, and not fond enough of either of them to make the effort, when it would count and they need to do so.And so Harry’s paranoia is fed, which pushes him further from them all. Until it pushes him to California.Some of it’s true - Camilla did probably leak nonsense to the press; his father did fail to address it in any meaningful way; and eventually the beast grew truly scary, in unprecedented ways.But if Harry had assessed which battles were worth fighting, and where the loyalty of each person lies, he might have been more effective in fighting the worthwhile fights. Instead, he demands they all come out every day and denounce details like why Meghan didn’t wear green one day, or why she got into a car before the Queen. These things aren’t worth reading in the first place - why bother fueling them, Harry? There are a lot of things Harry is still fueling here that really should have been laid to rest - the bridesmaids dresses, AGAIN 🙄. And that leads back to Harry’s overall mental health, and the origin of his mostly untreated PTSD, his mother’s death.And here, I come to Harry’s story as a child of a person who lost a parent at the same age as Harry did. I came into my mother’s life 19 years after she lost her father, as Meghan did into Harry’s life. And as my mom sorted out what this loss really meant once she became a parent in her thirties, Harry does, too. Having grown up watching that, my compassion for Harry’s pain is infinite. Losing a parent at that age is seismic. It affects everything about you for the rest of your life. Period. So much of Harry’s sorrow, alienation, and emotional stuntedness is inevitable, in my experience. Perhaps if Charles hadn’t remarried the woman he’d cheated on Harry’s mother with … but he did. Perhaps if Harry had married Chelsy Davy, whose parents sound like they could have served as healthy surrogates for him … but he didn’t. Perhaps if Harry had some outlet like art, music, writing, something therapeutic to channel the pain … but he only sought out physical pain in sports to shed some of the excess anger & anxiety he carried. So many sliding doors that could have shaped the impact… but once Diana died, the impact would overshadow all, and last forever. There was no escaping that. Harry learned the lesson we all learn eventually: that everything can change in the blink of an eye, and nothing is ever the same again. He learned it younger than most of us have to. It’s unfair. It’s tragic.I hope Harry has purged these demons. I hope time away from the British press and the institution give him the peace he needs to rebuild himself. I hope he’s still getting therapy. And I hope he apologizes to Kate for putting her texts in his book. First, because that’s just effed up. Second, because she really doesn’t look like a villain here, just a harried mom. And third, because he doesn’t have a chance in hell of reconciling with his brother if he doesn’t. I hope he gets to the point that he understands that.Show more",3,35 What to say about this book about which much has been said and is only half the storyI think one of the interesting things I found

Rating 2 out of 5,"I think the ghost writer did a great job with what material he had, though Harry’s abrupt change from one subject to another leads you to believe it’s hard for him to focus. It heart-breaking in the beginning as he speaks of the death of his mother and recurring impacts it has on his life but this was what interested me most about the book. It did get a bit boring in the middle so I skipped to the end to see what these much advertised, explosive revelations about the royal family would entail. There were only a couple of things I haven’t heard before but I also don’t keep up with all of the news anyway. His bitterness with the “paps” or paparazzi is noted from page one and is so prevalent one can almost taste it. He goes so far as to defend the drunk driver that was driving Princess Diana the night she died, saying that the driver, contrary to the first the statement made in the first investigative report that the driver was going over 100 mph was actually going 65 mph, and he states the tunnel is so short that even someone who is totally trashed could drive through it. I just find it difficult to believe if you are trying to outrun several people on motorcycles you are going only 65 mph. I get that he blames them for chasing her in the first place and taking photos instead of giving her and the other passengers and driver medical attention or getting them medical attention, but to completely deny the driver had any plausibility in the accident is blatantly irresponsible. I will say his allegation that Charles and Camilla sacrificed his and William’s reputation to increase their own PR ratings is one I cannot reconcile with the portrait that Harry creates of Charles as a loving and doting father. I also don’t believe that William attacked Harry. For someone to have that level of temper, there would have been some sign in 40 years and the only one who has shown that temperament is Harry. I think overall you have a little boy who is still lost, who still can’t find his place and instead of working himself, he’s pointing fingers at those he believes should have stepped in to help. It has the ring of “If I’m going down I’m taking everyone with me.” And I think it’s really easy to point fingers when you know there won’t be any pointing back at you. I might have believed his claims more had he bothered to include his own misdeeds and wrongdoings when it came to his relationships within his family, but as always he was the victim.With Meghan I think he has found someone who is willing to listen and agree with him, whether he’s right or wrong. For whatever reason, she chooses to take Harry’s word at face value without listening or considering Harry may be misremembering (of which he states he is guilty, several times in the book) or over exaggerating. She may be guilty of the same, who knows?

Rating 2 out of 5,"I have many thoughts and mixed feelings. Yes, this is a celebrity memoir, but it's also a lightning rod for cultural commentary. (Are you Team Cambridge or Team Sussex? Hannah B. or Luke P.? Taylor Swift or Kanye West? You can tell a lot about a person.) I will say that I am a huge fan of Harry and Meghan, and this shoddy memoir did not change that. I understand criticism of their PR team. The Oprah interview and the podcast production company and the Netflix special and the 60 Minutes interview and now this memoir is a lot for any audience, especially an often unsympathetic one, to take in all at once. With such a traumatic history of overexposure, I don't understand the strategy here. But I'm reminded of a plausible defense of the Midnights album: She's a smart woman, and she created the album she wanted to make, whether or not we liked it. I have to think that this memoir was as much on his own terms as Harry could manage.That said, I think his editor (and maybe also his therapist) failed him. Many of these stories should have stayed in the vault. I now know way more about the royal jewels than I ever wanted to. Alongside poignant and heartbreaking vulnerability were grievances that came across as petty — for example, about the inconvenience of borrowing a tiara from the queen for Meghan to wear at her wedding. While I believe this incident might have signified a lot to him, it only gives ammunition to the significant number of people who have never and will never be on his side.This leads me to think that his purpose for this memoir was more to unburden himself than to rehabilitate his image. I mean, why wait for the press to unveil the skeletons in your closet when you can get out ahead of them with a bestselling memoir (and use the profits to pay for your family's much-needed security detail after the palace cuts you off). A major accomplishment in terms of setting the record straight, however, is disproving anyone who blames Meghan for conspiring to break up the royal family. It seemed clear to me that he wanted out long before he met her; if anything, I think his need to protect her after losing his mother to the same deadly force gave him the courage he needed to make the break.There is much more of this book — at least a third of it — detailing his military career than I expected. I found myself really bored through those parts, waiting for Meghan to get on the scene. I realized I care about her exponentially more than I care about him, and I'm excited for her inevitable memoir.I want to care, but sometimes he makes it hard. His attempts at acknowledging his privilege and checkered history felt flimsy. For example: The most consistent antagonist in his story is the British press, but in the later parts of the memoir, once he starts dating Meghan, he writes as vividly about his experience of their harassment as of hers. I guess this is his prerogative in his own memoir, but it is absurd to claim to have felt the same weight of emotion watching her being subjected to racist, sexist vitriol as she did living it.I think that's all I have to say for now.

Rating 4 out of 5,"Spare by Prince Harry, The Duke of Sussex Random House AudioAudible Release: January 10, 2023Listening Length: 15 hours 39 minutes Narrators: Prince Harry, The Duke of SussexGenre: Memoir/Non-FictionKKECReads Overall Rating: 4/5KKECReads Rating for Performance: 5/5KKECReads Rating for Story: N/A (memoir)I purchased the audiobook on Amazon, and I leave my review voluntarily. Prince Harry, The Duke of Sussex, is a husband, father, humanitarian, military veteran, mental wellness advocate, and environmentalist. He resides in Santa Barbara, California, with his family and three dogs.“Two years older than me, Willie was the heir. Whereas me, I was the spare.”Prince Harry tells his life story, to date, from his perspective. I pre-ordered this audiobook the day it was available. This is entirely unheard of, though much of Harry’s recent life has been unheard of. Hearing Harry tell his story from his perspective was interesting. It had some insights into what growing up royal was like. He shared his memories of his mother with us.Those were the chapters that were the most emotional for me. The chapters where Harry discusses the accident, the funeral, and the aftermath. It was heartbreaking to hear that he thought Princess Diana was hiding and that she would come for Harry and William later. I don’t feel like this is a book I can review in the same way I would normally. One, who am I to agree or disagree with what’s been said? I cannot verify (or otherwise) anything in this book. Not really. And I don’t see King Charles or Prince William issuing any legit response. If anything, it will be the typical canned post that basically says nothing. I was impressed with Harry’s narration performance. He did really well, bringing the various aspects to life, creating voices, accents, etc. He has a lovely speaking voice, maybe a brand new career as a book narrator would be in his future. I’d listen to him read books. At the end of this book, I wish happiness upon all parties involved. I hope Harry and his family are enjoying the Californian sunshine, finding reasons to smile, and living their best lives.

Rating 5 out of 5,"I finally got to read Spare by Prince Harry and it did not disappoint. I tried stay away from spoilers before I read it, although I did watch the Netflix show. I have a long interest in the royal family that comes from my grandmother, so I was excited to read this book and I have so many thoughts and emotions which cannot all be captured here.Prince Harry and I are almost exactly the same age. When Princess Diana died, I was turning 13 and preparing for my Bat Mitzvah. Prince Harry had just lost his mother and had to walk behind her coffin to the funeral. My heart went out to him then, as it does now.This book is very well-written. The way it was organized made it really easy to get completely swept up. It’s divided into three sections: after Princess Diana died, army service, and after meeting Meghan. He remembered so many details – some of the army ones I could have lived without but maybe it was healing for him to write about it. I wrote down many powerful quotes, but to keep everything in context, I won’t share them.The overarching theme of the book is the royal family’s relationship with the media. Specifically, how the media has treated Prince Harry throughout his life, and the consequences of their actions, including the death of Princess Diana and the attacks in the press on Prince Harry and Meghan Markle that led to their move to the US. It’s clear that Prince Harry has always wanted to be free of the restrictions and invasion that come with being part of the royal family, and he has been significantly affected by his mother’s death. I think it’s sad that it’s come to this, but maybe he had to share his story to explain what led to he and Meghan leaving Britain, for those, including his own family members, that didn’t understand. We see so many events that have played out in the media through his eyes. It isn’t surprising that Prince Harry will do anything to ensure the physical, emotional and mental safety of family. Nothing could be more important than that.Show more",5,I finally got to read Spare by Prince Harry and it did not disappoint I tried stay away from spoilers before I read it although I did watch the Netflix show I have a long interest in the royal family that comes from my grandmother so I was excited to read this book and I have so many thoughts and emotions which cannot all be captured herePrince Harry and I are almost exactly the same age When Princess Diana died I was turning 13 and preparing for my Bat Mitzvah Prince Harry had just lost his mother and had to walk behind her coffin to the funeral My heart went out to him then as it does nowThis book is very wellwritten The way it was organized made it really easy to get completely swept up Its divided into three sections after Princess Diana died army service and after meeting Meghan He remembered so many details  some of the army ones I could have lived without but maybe it was healing for him to write about it I wrote down many powerful quotes but to keep everything in context I wont share themThe overarching theme of the book is the royal familys relationship with the media Specifically how the media has treated Prince Harry throughout his life and the consequences of their actions including the death of Princess Diana and the attacks in the press on Prince Harry and Meghan Markle that led to their move to the US Its clear that Prince Harry has always wanted to be free of the restrictions and invasion that come with being part of the royal family and he has been significantly affected by his mothers death I think its sad that its come to this but maybe he had to share his story to explain what led to he and Meghan leaving Britain for those including his own family members that didnt understand We see so many events that have played out in the media through his eyes It isnt surprising that Prince Harry will do anything to ensure the physical emotional and mental safety of family Nothing could be more important than thatShow more
Rating 4 out of 5,"“She [Diana] reminded the world that respect and compassion aren’t gifts, they’re the least we owe each other.”I found this to be a worthwhile and touching read. I’m not sure I could write a cohesive review, so here are a couple musings:1. I think Malorie Blackman said it best: “Reading is an exercise in empathy; an exercise in walking in someone else's shoes for a while.” In the coverage and public reaction (particularly within Britain), I found it difficult to understand the scarcity of empathy. Even in America, many people scoff at Meghan and Harry, unable to comprehend how royalty could experience and express any pain or anxieties. They find it unnerving— insulting. Yet,Pain is pain. Struggles with mental health are allowed for anyone. And, I don’t know, if any good can come from some Britons weird, parasocial relationship with the anachronistic monarchy of today, it should be the understanding that royals are just damaged human beings rather than these figures once viewed as being ordained by God. 2. I feel it poignantly describes the negative effects grief can have on you. To lose a parent that young is unimaginable to me, especially to then have the lack of familial or institutional support. Ultimately, to see the “Spare” forge his own way and find peace with his new family was cathartic. I think many people think that when someone is open about the slights of their childhood or the pernicious elements of their family as a whole, that they somehow are ungrateful and disloyal. I find it to be something extremely difficult to do, but sometimes necessary if you want to live a healthier, fuller life. We should want to improve what came before us. Isn’t that kind of the point?3. Really, I don’t think the core of this book was to full-on point the finger at his father or brother as depicted by the media. Much of the book instead admonishes the seedy press. Still, you get the impression many of the royals are pitiful, but nevertheless complicit victims of a ridiculous, corrupt system. I feel I have more to say, but can’t quite articulate anything else. It’s a great read, I recommend it.Show more",4,She Diana reminded the world that respect and compassion arent gifts theyre the least we owe each otherI found this to be a worthwhile and touching read Im not sure I could write a cohesive review so here are a couple musings1 I think Malorie Blackman said it best Reading is an exercise in empathy an exercise in walking in someone elses shoes for a while In the coverage and public reaction particularly within Britain I found it difficult to understand the scarcity of empathy Even in America many people scoff at Meghan and Harry unable to comprehend how royalty could experience and express any pain or anxieties They find it unnerving insulting YetPain is pain Struggles with mental health are allowed for anyone And I dont know if any good can come from some Britons weird parasocial relationship with the anachronistic monarchy of today it should be the understanding that royals are just damaged human beings rather than these figures once viewed as being ordained by God 2 I feel it poignantly describes the negative effects grief can have on you To lose a parent that young is unimaginable to me especially to then have the lack of familial or institutional support Ultimately to see the Spare forge his own way and find peace with his new family was cathartic I think many people think that when someone is open about the slights of their childhood or the pernicious elements of their family as a whole that they somehow are ungrateful and disloyal I find it to be something extremely difficult to do but sometimes necessary if you want to live a healthier fuller life We should want to improve what came before us Isnt that kind of the point3 Really I dont think the core of this book was to fullon point the finger at his father or brother as depicted by the media Much of the book instead admonishes the seedy press Still you get the impression many of the royals are pitiful but nevertheless complicit victims of a ridiculous corrupt system I feel I have more to say but cant quite articulate anything else Its a great read I recommend itShow more
Rating 5 out of 5,"5 starsmemoir(noun) - a book or other piece of writing based on the writer's personal knowledge of famous people, places, or events.No idea why people have hard time accepting about mental illness or traumas, even when the person suffering is asking for help. Is it because it is not visible, like bleeding wound or a broken bone? This book is about Prince Harry's ""princely"" experience of being born a royal. Clearly its his side of story, he is not talking for other royal members, he is just telling what happened , how he felt. And if this is what he felt, then who are we to judge.Harry shares his life in 3 phases. First phase-His childhood starting from his mother's death , dealing with the shock, school, college with a void for his mother along with paps.Second phase-His army career. His trips to Africa. His failing romances. Dealing with paps.Third phase-He finding Meghan. Him falling in love, leading to marriage and fatherhood. Him stepping back from royal duties. Dealing with paps.Harry has shared so much about his life, his feelings about others, his hatred towards paps (seriously what has journalism fallen down to?), his hatred towards being royal first and family later. This book shows how much Harry does not care anymore. Its like a open war saying you made money out of lies about me. Now see how much will the truth cost. His outright revolt against the way the royals work, the tabloids in UK works and most of all, for being invalidated by his own family. As Harry says, every member has been abused by these lies told by press, but just to remain in news one cannot let lies to be spread and fool people. I am pretty sure that the ""Palace"" is silent on the release of this memoir and any news being printed is just hocus pocus :)Wonderfully written, so raw, though its only one sided story, it is a very powerful one.Short chapters , very well narrated and vulnerable.

Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 stars. I felt the writing was average and it could have been edited better. Some portions were very detailed to the point of boredom. However, this book is very intriguing, considering it’s a very abnormal glimpse into the Royal Family and life as a Royal. I agreed with some reports that a lot of this book feels like a love letter to his mother. Diana is the backdrop of so much of his life - the trauma and pain he experienced growing up without her and never being able to properly grieve her. I felt a lot of compassion for the boy who lost his mom. I found it heartbreaking that no one even hugged him after he found out his mother was dead or talked to him about it… the fact he wondered for years if she was really dead. I see the projection of his life as perhaps following in his mother’s footsteps, as she also was not very supportive of the Royal Family and wanted freedom from it all. I would agree with Prince Harry’s statement in the book about being treated as “infantile” in so many ways as a Royal growing up and even as an adult, but then being pegged as immature once he left their employment. However, I don’t know that I trust his and his wife’s motives in all their interviews, Netflix specials and even this book. It perhaps is all about money, but on the other hand I do think everyone has a right to tell their own story. There were some areas where either him or Meghan feigned ignorance about certain things that I found completely unbelievable (like he really didn’t know he had to ask the Queen permission to marry? Or Meghan really didn’t know she still had to curtsy to the Queen even though it was his Grandmother? Or they really were surprised by the media and paparazzi after they got married?) In some of those aspects, I can understand the point of the Royal Family and how they weren’t willing to pay special attention to their situation when they hadn’t made any statements like that before in other situations. It’s hard to believe that the paparazzi was soooo much worse for them than it was for Princess Diana or Prince Charles or Camilla?

Rating 2 out of 5,"This review is not to comment on the fact that two young boys lost their mother and struggled with her death. This review is not about his military background, for which I applaud his service and resolve. This review is not about the deplorable British media and tabloids that forget that while they are the famous British Monarchy, they are still human and should be treated with some basic human decency. The Apache part drowned on for a bit and I think it bored me even more because I wasn't expecting it. This review IS however based on the incredible amount of whining from a grown man. It was too much. I'm so glad I read it and didn't listen to the audio, because I don't think I would have made it through the whining. The first few pages of the book read like a script from The Young and the Restless. The ""And so? Pa? Willy? World? Here you go."" literally made me want to vomit. Harry acts as though he is the very first spare in all of world history. That part was sickening. William didn't want his brother tagging along at Eton. How is this any different from any other older brother/ younger brother sibling rivalry? What makes them so special? He complains that the tabloids thought he was doing cocaine, then two sentences later admits to cocaine? I had to reread it to make sure I wasn't crazy. The crap between Meghan and Kate was so unbearably petty. So, Kate doesn't like people using her lip-gloss? I have a best friend that won't drink after anyone or share any food on her plate... does that make us enemies? So what if Kate was dressed ""to the nines"" and Meghan was in jeans. If each was comfortable, why does it matter? I think there is a lot of context over Princess Charlotte's bridesmaid dress missing and I can't find it in me to give crap. Also, your step-mother turning your bedroom into a dressing room at 29 years old, after you'd move out. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Overall, Prince Harry seems to take little to no responsibility for any of his own actions. He makes references to being sorry, but the line before or line after always references how someone else contributed. It seems that while he and Meghan both hold others accountable for all of their actions and words, they are not held to the same standard...Overall, I'm glad I read the book.

Rating 5 out of 5,"Go Harry! Ok this book is so much more than the noise the media is making about this book. It was actually a more emotional, insightful, and sad read than anything (I will say TW for panic attacks 😅)But also happy and sweet. It humanized Harry in a way that a documentary/interview couldn’t. I read an article about how he needed to write this book. This was for him—not airing dirty laundry, giving us the tea etc. 1. The ghost writer was amazing. This was well written. Flowed. Told the story. Loved the audio that was read by Harry. It was cheeky and funny at all the right times JUST LIKE we’ve seen him in the media. 2. War. Wow. I didn’t know how involved he was with the was in Afghanistan/Taliban. No idea. Amazing. It was a bulk of the book which I found surprising but once finishing its what brought harry so many meaningful and real life experiences. 3. The family stories will break your heart. Definitely felt more institution than family. But harry made his own way with friends that became family. The losses…just so sad. 4. Security. I cannot believe that people can look at pictures of him walking behind his mothers coffin and then 20 years later he has security pulled. I just can’t fathom how or why his father would do that knowing how dangerous the paps can be. I don’t blame them for walking away. 5. Despite what I personally think of Charles, Harry painted his father in the absolute best light possible. Charles needs to send his darling boy a thank you text but he’s probably too busy complaining about blasted pens. 6. Wow. The monarchy messed up huge by not embracing him and Meghan. Huge mistake. Lol I’m bored with just Will and Kate. 😂 and honestly they’re pretty boring in the book 😬😅7. People saying why did he write this book?

Rating 3 out of 5,"This was a dense one. Listening to Harry talk through his life, I can't say my opinions of the royals improved. If anything, I find them whinier than I did before Spare. The only one who grew a bit in my eyes was King Charles. I thought he would be more of a cold, uncaring father, but the book proved me wrong.The privilege of the members of this family is obvious, and it does them no good to live such a ""sheltered"" life (while being in the lenses of the press 24/7 - I see the irony). No wonder mental health issues are prevalent among them. I think anyone would go mad in their place, and for this I feel for them. Also, despite the fact that I find the royals naive, I don't agree with the harassment they face on a daily basis. No one should have to live with fearing their lives because the paparazzi have no sense of boundaries or reality. Circling back to the protagonist, I find Harry and Meghan's decision to leave the institution the only sane route they could've taken. History was bound to repeat itself had they remained in the bubble of those HRH titles. The treatment they got was outright inhumane, daunting and demoralizing. Harry touches on the impact the press had on his life as a young boy, too. He was never free from unwanted publicity, and he recognized that, in some ways, it comes with the job. I think with Spare, he took the matter in his own hands, publishing the exact stories he wanted people to read. I found some of them highly TMI (I'm sorry, Harry, but I really didn't want to hear about your ""south pole"" in such an extensive manner; I get staying true to yourself, but... c'mon), some of them nothing short of cringe, but some were moving (his relationship with Queen Elizabeth, for instance). Overall, I liked the rawness of the book in most cases. Harry speaking up about his struggles is a big step from someone with his background, and I think more members should follow suit. While his attitude is sometimes really telling of his privileged background, I think he's like the rest of us - he seeks peace. Peace to be with his wife and to raise their children, as well as peace within his extended family. I wonder if the latter kind of peace will ever see the light of day.

Rating 4 out of 5,"The fact that this exists at all is ridiculous - really cool to see the royals tear themselves apart in real time! It's like something out of The Crown. I knew v little about the royals going into this and there are some genuinely shocking revelations. They failed Meghan and Harry completely, no doubt. Prince William comes out of this looking like an absolute dildo, and Charles a bit useless. I don't think any of the royals seem to like being a royal, despite all the perks, because they've got all this money and status and they have absolutely no freedom to use it. It seems like a lot of them resent Harry for managing to break out of that. Also this family needs to COMMUNICATE more, actually talking *to each other* instead of passing messages between servants. Never thought I'd give a fig about the royals and their drama, but this has converted me. It feels like hisory.There's also one line which has been stuck in my head for weeks now and probably won't ever leave: Harry meets the guy who voices Lego Batman, and after recognising him says ""Ah of course, Batman Lego Movie"". Just such a weird way to say that. Some parts of this book feel like they've been poured over meticulously, making sure the messaging is exactly right, and others feel like a quick first draft. It's an engaging mix, and despite the odd ""thus"" this is very readable! There's hundreds of one/two page chapters that all lead seamlessly into each other, with very few time-jumps in the narrative. You really get to speed-run Prince Harry's life! One minute you're at the South Pole and the next you're tripping balls in Courtney Cox's bathroom. Is this normal for memoirs? Maybe I should read more memoirs, because this was a lot of fun, or maybe this one is exceptional because of how ridiculous this guy's life is.

Rating 4 out of 5,"I think it’s really hard to rate a memoir. But I think it would be even harder to write one. There are going to be so many people coming at you with “that’s not what happened” “that’s not true” “how could you say that” but we all have our own thoughts and feelings and memories of events in our lives. I found this book very interesting and informative, and enjoyed reading it. I felt I knew a decent amount about the royal family. I enjoy following their lives and duties as royals, however, I didn’t realize how ruthless and brutal the British press and paparazzi are. To say that someone born into royalty has asked for the lack of privacy and scrutiny is just ridiculous.The parts on Harry’s early life and military life were very interesting to me. I didn’t realize how much military presence he had in the war. And as much as I knew about the loss of his mom, Princess Diana, it was different to hear his memories of her and the night she died.Reading this book, I felt for Harry and Megan, that is a lot of hate and harsh words said about people. Have you ever had a negative comment on any social media post? Or has someone ever said anything hurtful and untrue about you? It’s hurts and it’s uncalled for, and to have that splashed across so much media written as truth cannot be an easy thing to deal with. I listened to the audiobook, which was read by Harry himself, and I think there is something to be said to hear someone tell their story, as opposed to just reading it. I liked this book, yes, some parts seemed scattered and choppy, but I think that’s how memories work. At the end of the day, he is a person, and this is his book of his life, how he remembers and sees it.

Rating 5 out of 5,"Harry’s life starts out like any prince’s would..privileged education, social life, family functions, but with the tragedy of his mother’s sudden death hanging over him. He doesn’t quite fit in academically, he’s more of an adventurer,sporty guy than serious royal. Like many wealthy teenagers, he parties and doesn’t seem to be able to find much of a purpose to his life. Then when he steps outside the palace, like Siddhartha, he finds there is suffering in the world and he develops empathy for animals and people who are suffering. He joins the military, flies Blackhawks , even goes to war in Afghanistan. He takes trips to Botswana and there finds a love of nature and wild animals. Saving them becomes a calling to him, just like honoring all the fallen and wounded soldiers he encountered. Then in the second half of his memoir, incidents with the press and family all point to the fact that he truly is a “spare,” and has no powerful person to back him, including his father, brother and the Queen. He is on his own. No one takes his side in the battle with with the racism shown to Meghan by the press. They literally kick him out totally, not giving him a compromise in duties and protection. The royal family underestimated Harry. Their idea of his existence is to shut up and do as you are told. And never be more popular than the King and Heir .. They underestimated Meghan too. She attended an all girl Catholic school which taught her empowerment as a woman. She,like Harry, devotes her life to doing good and helping people and animals. They have found peace and their place in the world Addendum: the only part I cannot praise Harry for is his continued hunting and killing of birds and hogs.Show more",5,Harrys life starts out like any princes wouldprivileged education social life family functions but with the tragedy of his mothers sudden death hanging over him He doesnt quite fit in academically hes more of an adventurersporty guy than serious royal Like many wealthy teenagers he parties and doesnt seem to be able to find much of a purpose to his life Then when he steps outside the palace like Siddhartha he finds there is suffering in the world and he develops empathy for animals and people who are suffering He joins the military flies Blackhawks  even goes to war in Afghanistan He takes trips to Botswana and there finds a love of nature and wild animals Saving them becomes a calling to him just like honoring all the fallen and wounded soldiers he encountered Then in the second half of his memoir incidents with the press and family all point to the fact that he truly is a spare and has no powerful person to back him including his father brother and the Queen He is on his own No one takes his side in the battle with with the racism shown to Meghan by the press They literally kick him out totally not giving him a compromise in duties and protection The royal family underestimated Harry Their idea of his existence is to shut up and do as you are told And never be more popular than the King and Heir  They underestimated Meghan too She attended an all girl Catholic school which taught her empowerment as a woman Shelike Harry devotes her life to doing good and helping people and animals They have found peace and their place in the world Addendum the only part I cannot praise Harry for is his continued hunting and killing of birds and hogsShow more
Rating 5 out of 5,"The powerful single word SPARE (“the heir and the spare”) titles this captivating, detailed, visceral, emotional, and well-written memoir. Part royal life, part adventure, part military, part love story, and part shit show, it is a behind the scenes memoir of a Prince we as spectators have watched grow into a man. I was taken with how open and self-aware Harry is, and he holds nothing back.I remember Diana & Charles’ wedding in 1980, I watched it on TV with my cousins in Germany. I remember the births of William & Harry. I remember the nasty divorce and drama with Camilla. I remember Diana’s own memoir, the Panorama interview, and Diana’s horrible death in 1997 after being chased by paparazzi in a Paris tunnel. I was glued to the TV during her funeral. I got up early to watch William & Kate’s wedding and Harry & Meghan’s wedding. The image of the 8 cousins standing around Queen Elizabeth’s casket as she lay in state was extremely moving. I’ve watched all the movies and documentaries and The Crown, and I’m fascinated by how history keeps repeating itself. Listening to Harry tell HIS story from his POV sheds a whole new light on things for me. He’s brought all the receipts and I believe him.If you read this book you’ll learn about a boy who was so traumatized by his Mother’s sudden death, he thought she had simply “disappeared” for years. He was stuck in grief for well over a decade. And you’ll learn about intense sibling rivalry and how competing press offices from the Queen, Charles and William created a dysfunctional prison to live within. The lengths the paparazzi went to to get photos to sell, or the press intercepting private letters to family and printing them in the paper is just next level. I’m horrified with just how bad it really was.Can we take a moment to talk about Harry & Meghan’s love story? They met on Instagram and he fell for her head over heels. He is so cute the way he talks about her, it is straight out of a romance novel. I love that their 3rd date was camping in Botswana. Meghan is well traveled, an activist, an entrepreneur, fun, loving and obviously beautiful. A little bit like Diana maybe? They seem perfect for each other. There are many people who say they should remain quiet. Stop whining! They are cashing in! Why are you still talking? But if you actually watch the Netflix series or read this memoir you’ll read about a true love story, how viscous the press & paps are and how the history of colonialism in the UK feeds directly into racist attacks towards Meghan. Harry tried for years to work privately with his family to create a better life for them without success, until finally they had to flee for their own wellbeing. I’m personally happy they got out.Harry & Meghan’s story is almost an exact repeat of Diana’s and I understand how he would be terrified of history repeating itself. Harry is Diana’s son through and through and is doing things her way. I was happy to read his story in his own words and I was captivated by the audiobook which Harry narrates.

Rating 3 out of 5,"I really wavered on my rating for this (shocker). I really appreciated the vulnerability and bravery it takes to write something like this, especially as a Royal when you're breaking hundreds of years of tradition by simply telling the truth and opening up. I also enjoyed getting this glimpse into Prince Harry's life and at least 1 side of the truth. I thought this was entirely too long, especially the military section. We literally have to know every single location you went during your military service? It felt a bit redundant and I definitely began getting bored and kept thinking ""where's Meghan?"" Certain parts also felt a bit...performative. A good example is the tiny little anecdote about him being in a the grocery checkout and someone's being rude to the cashier. He takes off his hat and sunglasses so they see who he is in hopes that they'll stop being rude? Like what was the reasoning of publishing that besides wanting us to think you're this faux superhero and a good person? The constant stating of admiration and understanding for his dad and William also got old. That's fine, and I'm sure you love your family but your family was really shitty to you and it's ok to be angry. It just felt very performative at times and that wasn't my jam. Now, I think he seems so down to earth and I LOVED reading all about his charity work and the causes he cares about. Obviously everything about Diana is utterly tragic and I did tear up a few times throughout. Brits are the OG colonizers and apparently racist as hell (again, shocker).

Rating 3 out of 5,2.5 ⭐️ audiobooked at 1.4x speed I think the best memoirs are those where there is an overall theme that all the chapters fit into. It’s obvious that Harry’s intention was for his theme to be about the harm the media has caused him and his family throughout his life. However the first 2/3rds only seem to loosely hold to this theme. I think the problem was harry knew the theme he wanted but also wanted to include all sorts of stories that he just wanted people to know (I.e his frostbitten penis) and his editor didn’t have the heart to tell him no. The parts that actually tied into his theme were decent and that’s why the last part of the book I think actually enjoyed a bit. There definitely is some tea shared however I’m not a large consumer of celebrity news much less news about the royal family so a lot of it was new Info for me. Also I think a lot of this book could have been condensed if the entire royal family went to therapy both as a family and as individuals. Finally this is random and nitpicky but Harry’s love for Africa was giving colonialism hardcore. I know he spent a lot of time there and all but idk something about a white man from the royal family being obsessed with Africa and minimally acknowledging why there were so many common wealth African countries just rubbed me the wrong way.Read it/listen to it if you are interested in the royal family but otherwise I don’t think it’s worth your time. Also if you do listen to it I’d recommend 1.4 speed. P.s. harry blames the media for his mothers death but I think we all know that was thanks to his father and the queen and the info in this book can’t tell me otherwise.

Rating 5 out of 5,"4.5 starsI enjoyed this book. The experience is even greater when you listen to it. Harry did a phenomenal job. I think 2 common misconceptions are that 1. Harry and Meghan left the royal family because they wanted privacy. 2. Harry and William were the closest brothers and the best of friends. 3. Meghan caused the problems between Harry and his family. Throughout the whole book, it became clear that these were not true from how Harry describes his life and experiences.Part 1 was about his childhood. Part 2 was his time in the military and trying to find peace and an escape from a life he didn’t choose and didn’t feel he had control over. And Part 3 was his and Meghan’s story. Finding love, creating a family and finding purpose. It was interesting to see his life from his perspective. It was very clear to me that he had negative feelings about the British media ever since he was a child and his mother, Princess Diana died. It saddens me that it took him so much of his life to process her passing. He wasn’t able to process his feelings and emotions throughout his life. Harry has always had a complicated relationship with his brother and father. But also, his entire family. I think Charles and William were bitter because Harry made the choice to protect Meghan when they hadn’t made that choice for their wives. Harry decided it was not okay and he was going to do something about it. Other royals may have had to deal with the press talking about them and creating stories, but Meghan also had the racial aspect. The British press is racist in my opinion. Meghan didn’t deserve the vile things that were written about her. In addition, no one should have to deal with being harassed and stalked by the press. I’m glad that Harry made a stand against them. In my opinion, there have been 30+ books written about Harry as well as thousands of articles about him as well as Meghan. If others are allowed to tell his story, he has the right to tell his story for himself. His family let him down so many times by not standing up for him or caring how he felt about anything. I’m glad that he’s finally told his story.

Rating 3 out of 5,"It took me a significant amount of time to get into this book as it just didn't quite seem to sound like Harry. This is not surprising considering a ghost writer was used. The media coverage showed quotations completely out of context to dissuade the general public from taking the book seriously - not surprising that the media hate this book considering the role they've played in Prince Harry's life. A lot of poor ratings before the release were the result of this. Overall, this book was very informative. It was interesting to see some of the inner workings of the royal family and also to see Harry's perspective on everything that happened with the media concerning his past relationships. It all escalated when Meghan entered the picture. Most of the things that happened to Meghan, Harry and their children were horrendous. The amount of lies spread is just unbelievable. I'll never understand how the media can do this to another human, especially after what happened to Diana. All Harry has ever wanted is keeping his family safe. To read about how dark things got for Meghan was very sad. Particularly the part about her miscarriage as many will understand how they were both feeling while going through their loss. Part 1 was slow, part 2 slowly got better and part 3 was my favourite part. If the book were only part 3, I'd have rated this 5* but because it felt like a chore at the beginning, I can only rate this 3*.Show more",3,It took me a significant amount of time to get into this book as it just didnt quite seem to sound like Harry This is not surprising considering a ghost writer was used The media coverage showed quotations completely out of context to dissuade the general public from taking the book seriously  not surprising that the media hate this book considering the role theyve played in Prince Harrys life A lot of poor ratings before the release were the result of this Overall this book was very informative It was interesting to see some of the inner workings of the royal family and also to see Harrys perspective on everything that happened with the media concerning his past relationships It all escalated when Meghan entered the picture Most of the things that happened to Meghan Harry and their children were horrendous The amount of lies spread is just unbelievable Ill never understand how the media can do this to another human especially after what happened to Diana All Harry has ever wanted is keeping his family safe To read about how dark things got for Meghan was very sad Particularly the part about her miscarriage as many will understand how they were both feeling while going through their loss Part 1 was slow part 2 slowly got better and part 3 was my favourite part If the book were only part 3 Id have rated this 5 but because it felt like a chore at the beginning I can only rate this 3Show more

He establishes that narrative right from the beginning and every step of the way, every memory he recounts is tainted by the press, so then by the time we get to the end, of course we empathize with his and his wife’s desire to remove themselves from all that. I also admit I liked his recount of his and Meghan’s early love affair, it was really sweet. This book does not get more than 3 stars from me because the family drama leaves me feeling a bit ick. Not to mention I feel like he lacks accountability and growth in some of his memories (sighting his ignorance and privilege when calling his friend a Paki yet in the next couple chapters, referring to the North Pole as “frostnipistan”. where’s the growth?). Don’t get me wrong I love a good reality TV show and all the drama, but I equally hate hypocrites. Harry wants to spout all this importance about privacy and family but then go off and air all their dirty laundry. I guess he’s cut off and needs money, so if you can’t beat them join them, but it’s a messed up life to live. He could be better.This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review",3,This book gets 3 stars from me because it is very effective in gaining empathy for Harry through to the end This autobiography is mostly about his hate for the press and its entanglement with his family He establishes that narrative right from the beginning and every step of the way every memory he recounts is tainted by the press so then by the time we get to the end of course we empathize with his and his wifes desire to remove themselves from all that I also admit I liked his recount of his and Meghans early love affair it was really sweet This book does not get more than 3 stars from me because the family drama leaves me feeling a bit ick Not to mention I feel like he lacks accountability and growth in some of his memories sighting his ignorance and privilege when calling his friend a Paki yet in the next couple chapters referring to the North Pole as frostnipistan wheres the growth Dont get me wrong I love a good reality TV show and all the drama but I equally hate hypocrites Harry wants to spout all this importance about privacy and family but then go off and air all their dirty laundry I guess hes cut off and needs money so if you cant beat them join them but its a messed up life to live He could be betterThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilersShow full review
Rating 4 out of 5,"A anecdote that seems relevant to reading this book. Before this book came out I was trying to get on the holds list on Libby but it wasn't coming up. Huh, let me search by the author's name I thought. Harry....um....does he have a last name? And a quick trip to Google seemed to confirm that while he does have several names, none of them really function as a last name. Harry, Duke of Sussex only really applied after he got married (relatively recently) so for most of his life he just didn't really have a last name. In the Army they often seem to refer to him as ""Wales"" which I realized is sort of the closest he has to functional last name? It's just one of those moments where you realize how rarefied a life he has lead and is documenting. A lot of of the really juicy bits of this leaked almost immediately upon release but it was good to read them all in context. For such a long book, this is compulsively readable. I thought it dragged a little in the middle section (especially because the beginning and ending sections are the more well known parts of his story) but solid all around. Regardless of how you feel about Harry specifically, I think it's hard to deny this is a man who has lived through a lot of personal trauma in a series of unique circumstances, and it's interesting to hear his perspective on them. Even if we can't know if this is the objective truth, even if we never really hear the other side. It's shocking to watch ""Never complain, never explain"" is treated like Godly doctrine instead of a public relations strategy that might need to be re-evaluated in the face of horrific racism and also a changing media environment. I'm not interested in arguing with anyone, we are all entitled to our opinions, but it seems to me undeniable that Harry seems to be a person who has suffered and has done some deep psychological work (that it doesn't seem like anyone else in his family has ever or is seriously engaged in) and has come out of the other side in a better place. That may have involved doing things that you don't agree with, but it's not your life. It's his, and Spare is a compelling documentation of that life.

Rating 2 out of 5,"From the get I anticipated this book was a money grab and after reading it, I can confirm it is. The book is so long and boring, Harry really should have hired a ghost writer to avoid all the unneccesary stories (yes, including the frostbit peen story). I saw someone say in their review that Harry is an ordinary guy who happens to be royal and I think that's unexpectedly accurate. Until Meg comes into the book two-thirds of a way in, there are very few interesting stories, unless you're interested in his war stories or drug use. Most of this book are his complaints about the media (which I do find valid) but come off so whiney and oversold. In his eyes none of his actions are wrong, rather the paparazzi should not have been there in the first place to capture these idiotic moments (a Nazi suit SERIOUSLY??).I do feel for Meghan and do believe that the institution really left them to the wolves. However, this book doesn't reveal anything new that wasn't discussed in their netflix series Harry & Meghan. So again, I say, money grab. Overall, I can't get back the 15 hours I spent listening to the audiobook, but I can say Harry is a little b and so are William and Kate (Meghan is still perfection in my eyes).Show more",2,From the get I anticipated this book was a money grab and after reading it I can confirm it is The book is so long and boring Harry really should have hired a ghost writer to avoid all the unneccesary stories yes including the frostbit peen story I saw someone say in their review that Harry is an ordinary guy who happens to be royal and I think thats unexpectedly accurate Until Meg comes into the book twothirds of a way in there are very few interesting stories unless youre interested in his war stories or drug use Most of this book are his complaints about the media which I do find valid but come off so whiney and oversold In his eyes none of his actions are wrong rather the paparazzi should not have been there in the first place to capture these idiotic moments a Nazi suit SERIOUSLYI do feel for Meghan and do believe that the institution really left them to the wolves However this book doesnt reveal anything new that wasnt discussed in their netflix series Harry  Meghan So again I say money grab Overall I cant get back the 15 hours I spent listening to the audiobook but I can say Harry is a little b and so are William and Kate Meghan is still perfection in my eyesShow more
Rating 4 out of 5,"As someone who just finished this book, and seeing no reviews from others who have actually read it, I feel a moral obligation to leave a review. 3.5 stars rounded up to 4 due to the preemptive hate.This book reads as an extreme stream of consciousness and is slightly tedious to get into. However, it is a vulnerable and at times overtly descriptive account of Prince Harry’s life. For those of you looking for drama - he very much so delivers.It is clear that he wrote this book after much reflection and deeply dives into the various traumas he suffered. Does his privilege seep through the writing at points? Absolutely. Did I find myself deeply sympathizing with him? Very much so. I found myself pleasantly surprised by the writing itself. Prince Harry has a very poetic way of writing, constantly connecting themes and stories throughout the book. Sharp prose, detailed accounts and foreshadowing, and an unprecedented naming of villainous figures make for a scintillating and engrossing read. The book is split into 3 parts; the first about his childhood post Princess Diana’s death, the second about his time in the military, and the third his story with Meghan. We see how his grief shaped his childhood. The lack of support and loneliness further crippling him. He is held prisoner in a lifestyle devoid of independence and later finds himself stuck and aimless. We also get much insight into his familial relationships especially those between him and his brother and father and how they became strained over time. He unsparingly writes of the personal and institutional failures that affected his life, while also touching on his own unconscious biases and gaps in thinking. This book is not all bleak as I am making it out to be, but also vividly details his healing. Whether it is finding peace in Botswana, a sense of belonging during his time in Afghanistan, or the impacts of therapy he writes rawly and freely of his journey to happiness.I do have issues with the way he writes about British imperialism and the affects of colonialism. He half-heartedly addressed how the monarchy was built off the blood and labor of African and Asian countries and was a bit insensitive at some points- I was not impressed.At the end of the day when so many others have profited off of telling untrue stories about H and M’s lives, why should they, themselves, not be able to profit while speaking their truth? Of course the real truth is probably some middle ground between their and the institution’s version of events, however this memoir allows one to understand Harry’s character and thought processes and form an opinion for themselves.No matter what your feelings towards the institution or the Sussexes, I urge you to read this with an open mind and truly try to empathize with the very people who’s lives are affected by the vitriol spewed by the British media. As for the quotes currently circulating around, much has been taken out of context.

Rating 3 out of 5,"As a memoir, this is pretty standard fair. It reveals exactly what the author wants and leaves other things intentionally out (there was, for example, very little talk about his relationship with his Grandfather, and for much of the memoir it's as if the Prince didn't exist when Harry talks about his family). It is both a devoted hagiography of Meghan and a crucifixion of the British press and those who enable it. At some points there is extreme self awareness, at others it is clearly lacking. There are large parts that weren't as compelling as I hoped they would be but ultimately, it would be a great memoir for studying memoirs. It's an ideal example for studying the art of creating one and understanding one critically (who wrote this? why did they write it? what reasons could they have for talking about X? what reasons could they have for taking out Y? what themes does this author want you to focus on when thinking of their story? What is the role of truth in memoirs? How reliable are narrators when talking about their own lives? How can trauma and memory play into accuracy?) but in terms of the salacious, shocking, bombshell book the press wants you to believe it is...it isn't that. It's a perfectly normal memoir, and that's okay.Show more",3,As a memoir this is pretty standard fair It reveals exactly what the author wants and leaves other things intentionally out there was for example very little talk about his relationship with his Grandfather and for much of the memoir its as if the Prince didnt exist when Harry talks about his family It is both a devoted hagiography of Meghan and a crucifixion of the British press and those who enable it At some points there is extreme self awareness at others it is clearly lacking There are large parts that werent as compelling as I hoped they would be but ultimately it would be a great memoir for studying memoirs Its an ideal example for studying the art of creating one and understanding one critically who wrote this why did they write it what reasons could they have for talking about X what reasons could they have for taking out Y what themes does this author want you to focus on when thinking of their story What is the role of truth in memoirs How reliable are narrators when talking about their own lives How can trauma and memory play into accuracy but in terms of the salacious shocking bombshell book the press wants you to believe it isit isnt that Its a perfectly normal memoir and thats okayShow more
Rating 1 out of 5,"A rather boring ""poor me"" that reeks of privilege, fails to fully understand and own that, and occasionally falls back on simply blaming that. I'm all for seeing the palace burn, I'm no royalist - but sometimes whistleblowers aren't heroes. That appears to be the case here. Legitimate gripes about the media treatment seem to fall away when he can't quite ever fully own that his exploration of the world and the choice he has made have all come from a snap of the fingers. Harry went to both the North and South Pole. That must have been nice. Harry met his bride as their eyes locked in corporate boxes at Wimbledon. That must have been nice. Most of the book is just downright fucking boring. But I read it. So I can say that. The token single line about his uncle being investigated for sex crimes showed this was no real burning of the palace at all. Just a spoiled brat monetising his ham-fisted exit-strategy. Nothing to see here. The legitimate discussion around the racist/sexist treatment of his wife is not up for debate. But it's almost a footnote here, to a life of bored privilege, and some latent trauma that is no doubt legtimate but is also being mined for retirement-cash.

Rating 4 out of 5,"My big takeaway from this wildly popular memoir? I feel bad for Harry. A notable quote, ""royal fame was fancy captivity."" Breaks my heart. He was clearly traumatized with his mothers death. He never seemed to connect well with his dad or have a close relationship to him, Charles always called him ""darling boy"" (sounds like they didn't interact that much if that was always the case). In recent years his relationship with William has been strained. My hope for him is that him and Meghan and children can have a happy life. The end. Prince Harry didn't sign up for this Royal life. It was thrust upon him with no choice of his own. I respect his choice to live the life he chooses. Shame on anyone who thinks they know better than he and how he should live his own life. I found the book insightful to hear him tell his version and side of stories. Not that there needs to be any ""sides"". Some was boring (like the long war years) and some were fun (like when he and Meghan first starting dating).

Rating 5 out of 5,"So I read the book, but also listen to the audio which may have impacted my score. I really liked his writing style and this book made me feel so many different emotions. The beginning hit so hard, you just feel everything that Harry feels, especially when it comes to his brother. There were so many surprises, for example the spin doctor that was hired by Camilla and Charles that started articles saying that Harry was a drug addict as a teenager. It’s just so shocking to see what he had to grow up in and how that would impact him mentally. Him and his brother. And I don’t think I really understood how disgusting the paparazzi was until reading this book specifically when it came to people taking pictures of Diana while she was dying. It was all just very sad. It also makes you think about Americans versus British people and how they interact and how that may have impacted Meghan’s relationship to William and Kate. I’m giving this book a five because it really made me think about a lot of things.

Rating 1 out of 5,"i decided to read this in hopes of some drama even if it meant enduring the inevitable and excessive ignorance and privilege, but instead just got pro-monarchy sentiment, military propaganda, and white saviourism (which was not surprising in the least, but i was hoping for this to be somewhat interesting at the very least). then again, my first mistake was reading a memoir by a monarch and expecting any less. far too many mentions of his penis and not enough details about any remotely interesting events. i already despised prince harry and the royal family prior to reading this but this somehow made me hate him far more, which is a feat in itself. the fact that he brags about killing 25 Afghans—who he doesn’t even see as people, just “chess pieces” he knocked off the board—and that seems to derive some sick pleasure out of war says more than enough about this book and his character. this book is essentially just a means for harry to try to reap sympathy by constantly mentioning how he’s followed by paparazzi and to convince people that he’s better than the other royals because of how charitable he is. spare your timeShow more",1,i decided to read this in hopes of some drama even if it meant enduring the inevitable and excessive ignorance and privilege but instead just got promonarchy sentiment military propaganda and white saviourism which was not surprising in the least but i was hoping for this to be somewhat interesting at the very least then again my first mistake was reading a memoir by a monarch and expecting any less far too many mentions of his penis and not enough details about any remotely interesting events i already despised prince harry and the royal family prior to reading this but this somehow made me hate him far more which is a feat in itself the fact that he brags about killing 25 Afghanswho he doesnt even see as people just chess pieces he knocked off the boardand that seems to derive some sick pleasure out of war says more than enough about this book and his character this book is essentially just a means for harry to try to reap sympathy by constantly mentioning how hes followed by paparazzi and to convince people that hes better than the other royals because of how charitable he is spare your timeShow more
Rating 2 out of 5,"[audiobook]: ok........ wow...... I finished it. no one needs more Spare discourse but here's some more: my main thought is that there is shockingly little critical analysis of the system that led to (gestures) All Of That. there is a lot of blaming of individual members of the press (calling the paparazzi Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dummer was so cringe to me), or individual tabloids--and don't get me wrong, The Daily Mail is a garbage fire--but I expected him to do a bit more big picture thinking about *why* the system exists and questioning the monarchy/celebrity culture in capitalism at its roots. suing tabloids is fine and all, but there's something off in the tone of vilifying these people who are participating in a system that his family is complicit in creating and continuing! like, he ends the book by saying they now have an income after making some ""deals"" with companies like Netflix to ""tell their stories"" which.... yes.... and *why* is that HazZzzZ? anyway. some more critical thinking would have been nice.other thoughts, roughly in order: (1) the recollections of his childhood are interesting and quite tragic; the first 20% was absolutely my favorite part (2) why is this book so fucking long? is this ANOTHER war story???

Rating 3 out of 5,"I was originally not going to read this since I assumed it would mostly be about Harry's charity work (BORING AM I RIGHT lol kidding) but once I realized he was going to spill the tea...yes please.Most of the ratings on here are either a 1 or a 5 depending on if you're #TeamSussex or #TeamMonarchy; I think a three is fair from an objective standpoint. Some parts dragged (part 2 felt MUCH longer than parts 1 or 3), there was a lot of extraneous detail I'm not sure we really needed, and people keep praising the ghostwriter but honestly this didn't seem that well-written to me (although I don't usually read celebrity memoirs so maybe this is par for the course for writing in the genre, I wouldn't know). If you're interested in the story and don't mind the length I wouldn't dissuade you from reading it; you know the monarchy is bonkers but maybe not quite HOW bonkers, and there's a lot of interesting insight on the royal experience, as well as deliberate discussion of events to correct the record on big-name stories from the British press, especially as related to Meghan and family, which I think is all worth the read. Also, it's pretty wild to me that Harry's takeaway at the end is saying explicitly ""My problem has never been with monarchy, nor the concept of monarchy. It's been with the press and the sick relationship that has evolved between it and the palace."" Like...the press is clearly horrendous, but I feel like the monarchy may also be part of the problem.

That said, I appreciated listening to this story.

Hearing Harry speak about his grief over the loss of his mother, as a mother to 3 boys myself, was heartbreaking. Learning about Meghan’s experience entering into her royal role was also heartbreaking. As for highlights, I loved hearing about his work supporting veterans & wildlife, I commend him for his honesty around mental health, & I cried when he spoke about the birth of each of his children.

Rating 1 out of 5,"I had to DNF I think that his experience is so rich and deep. I acknowledge his pain and his hurts. As a spectator in the general public, I am intrigued of the weight of his decisions specifically with his royal family. I picked this book up knowing it would be a Non Fiction biographical read. I already have a hard time with these type of books. But ultimately I feel the need to DNF.

Rating 3 out of 5,"Those who share a passion for tennis, and tennis literature, will rejoice to find that this memoir is authored by the ghostwriter of Andre Agassi's brilliant memoir. J.R. Moehringer's mastery of the memoir is further displayed here, though I think his source material was a bit boring. I will admit that this does give a clearer picture of what the media has furiously been reporting over the last who knows how long. Still, there are times when I felt like pleading for Harry to ""get on with it"" as the Brits say. Regardless, the story provoked emotion. Chiefly, sadness. How sad it is that this family can't seem to get along. It's as if they all speak different languages. It's frustrating for the reader, as I'm sure it is for those actually involved. If anything, this memoir made clear to me how the Royal Family is so very normal. They fight over stupid things. They are stubborn. They do things they know will hurt those they love. All of them. Harry included. So, why can't they be like other families and just bury the freaking hatchet? That's what this memoir lacks: Resolution. We are missing the kumbaya moment. It doesn't feel finished.

Rating 2 out of 5,"My 2 cents:- The book is divided into three parts. The first part is incredibly boring and Harry comes across as whiny. He (sometimes rightfully) criticizes the Royal system, those who keep it alive and even his family, but never looks at himself with these critical eyes.- The second part is mostly about his time in the army which I found hard to get through for a multitude of reasons.- The book only somewhat redeems itself in the third part which is the part where Meghan comes in. Harry shares a lot of juicy information on how he and Megan met, his family’s initial positive response but how slowly his family and those around them started turning on them. This was very interesting to read from his/their perspective and I do think they were treated awfully during this period.- The book is not written well. Sentences are incredibly short, chapters are short which results into a lack of flow in his storytelling, and a lot of the stories were quite dull.- Where do I get this frostbite cream?Would’ve given it 1/5 if it hadn’t been for part 3, but it was still hard to get through.Show more",2,My 2 cents The book is divided into three parts The first part is incredibly boring and Harry comes across as whiny He sometimes rightfully criticizes the Royal system those who keep it alive and even his family but never looks at himself with these critical eyes The second part is mostly about his time in the army which I found hard to get through for a multitude of reasons The book only somewhat redeems itself in the third part which is the part where Meghan comes in Harry shares a lot of juicy information on how he and Megan met his familys initial positive response but how slowly his family and those around them started turning on them This was very interesting to read from histheir perspective and I do think they were treated awfully during this period The book is not written well Sentences are incredibly short chapters are short which results into a lack of flow in his storytelling and a lot of the stories were quite dull Where do I get this frostbite creamWouldve given it 15 if it hadnt been for part 3 but it was still hard to get throughShow more
Rating 3 out of 5,"This was a case study on paparazzi/press/media and privacy. Before reading, I assumed the book was primarily about the royal family and the drama within the family but quickly learned that it was about his relationship with the media.The book starts with his foundational relationship with the media and his mistrust and anger towards them for causing his mothers death. The press is the constant theme running through the whole book and it ends with his royal title being dissolved because of the media’s constant barrage and heckling of his family.When I read memoirs by the end of the book I can usually grasp the “why” of the book. This one I can’t quite grasp. Does he want media laws put in place? Does he want the monarchy to be done away with or want his title renewed? I guess he was tired of reading stories of his life and wanted to put his truth out there?

Rating 4 out of 5,"I’ll be honest — I’m not sure the best way to review a memoir. Memoirs are not usually my cup of tea, because I don’t really find them interesting, but I knew there was no way I wasn’t reading this one. I am an American who has historically never cared much about the British Royal Family. I was not one of the millions of Americans who woke up super early to watch William & Kate’s wedding. I didn’t have anything in particular against it . . . I just didn’t really care either way. I came to care through all of the horrific things I’d seen written about Meghan online. That was how I first became invested. I saw all the negative press and decided to start reading about it. And I was immediately Team Meghan. The memoir is split into three parts: childhood, military, and life with Meg. I wasn’t as interested in the military section of the book, but it was such a big part of Harry’s life that I understand why it was included. The book itself didn’t give me a whole lot of insight to things I didn’t already learn through interviews or early revelations from the book posted online, but it was still fascinating to see some of the inner workings about how the royal family works, interactions between the brothers, and more. Overall, a very solid read. I highly recommend listening to the audiobook as Harry is the narrator.

Rating 4 out of 5,"listened to this one on audible - 15 hours - whew. I’ve always loved Harry and I still do! Part 1 was mostly about his childhood and events leading up to Diana’s sudden death and the aftermath. His upbringing breaks my heart a bit and it’s quite amazing he’s turned out to be such a genuine, practical and good-hearted person considering all that he has gone through. Part 2 of the book was a little drawn out but good to hear about his military background and his life post school and before he met Meghan. I liked Part 3 the best (Meghan), even though I’ve watched Harry and Meghan’s Netflix documentary and countless interviews with them, so nothing was too earth shattering or breaking news to me. I’m with them all the way though. Officially can’t stand the whole “royals” and “monarchy” concept. It is SUCH bullshit how they all treated Meghan, how racist many Brits still are, and how ungodly AWFUL the British press is.

Rating 3 out of 5,I’ve always been interested in the Royal Family especially the lives of Prince Harry and William. I remember exactly what I was doing when news hit that Princess Diana had died in a car accident. My hope going into this was to find out more about Harry as a person. He has gone through so much throughout his life. I was disappointed with this memoir. I couldn’t get a sense of who he was and the life lessons and self reflection he might have experienced. I honestly did not feel there was any depth. You told us that you were not able to cry at your mother’s funeral and the first and only time you did was to your then girlfriend Cressida. Why was it then? There was no self reflection. I felt it was just a retelling. I would be interested to see another memoir from Harry in his later years possibly.

Rating 5 out of 5,"Prince Harry wrote a very inspiring account of his life as a Royal. Having the courage to do so brought him closer to try to find his own happiness.I appreciate reading all the stories from Prince Harry's childhood, his mother, Diana, life as a royal, military career and charitable works. Constantly being hounded by the paparazzi, or ""paps"" as Harry referred to them, did not make life any more easier. Like any young person, Prince Harry did sow his wild oats, but eventually found the love of his life, Meghan.It seems to me that he and his family were shunned by the Royal family and no matter how hard Harry and Meghan tried there didn't seem to be a middle ground. They were a courageous couple for heading out on their own to make a better life for their family.I really enjoyed reading this book.

And I actively avoid circus media because I don’t trust their agendas, and certainly haven’t watched the Sussexes on their worldwide ‘privacy’ tour. But I have an upcoming interview on SPARE, so went in objective. Let me just say, if you want juicy royal gossip, you will find it here. Which makes me a hypocrite, I suppose. But how else will we get behind palace walls? Harry broke LOTS of rules writing this. But if his words are true, one fully understands his polished middle finger to the Crown. He clearly suffers PTSD from losing his momma so young in a family that doesn’t hug. On the flip side he doesn’t take a lot of personal responsibility, and his constant jibes at William’s baldness, for example, just come across petty. But it is a page turner. And I learned a lot.

Rating 3 out of 5,beginning disclaimer: i am no a monarchist. i simply became obsessed w anne boleyn at the age of 8 and now i watch the royal family like reality tv. ok ANYWAY i do have to say the first section of the book was the most slay. i enjoyed the second two as well but truly if u watched the netflix show (i did) you can basically skip the last 1/3 though he gets more into the nitty gritty than the show did. obviously monarchy is bad for lots more reasons than this but the way it forces the family to be a business is none chilling to read about. my takeaway: meghan and harry are in the right they just happen to be annoying people so they don’t fit into the perfect victim complex. SPOILERY STUFF AHEAD:the penis stuff is just as ridiculous as you think it is. i will say the problem is that harry and meghan are right but when every 30 seconds they’re discussing “spirituality” you just want to lost your mind. the stuff about charles was the most fascinating tbh my opinion on him hasn’t changed but i definitely learned some new and odd stuff about him. i know it’s cliche to blame the woman but camilla is definitely behind every single leak. that’s all.

Rating 5 out of 5,"For some unaccountable reason I really enjoyed this book. The writing was good, and although I know there is a writer behind Prince Harry's words there is an honesty and a rather stunning self-awareness to the biographical narrative. I found the book compelling, interesting.I've always been somewhat of an anglophile, but not because of the monarchy. I read so many English authors as a young person -- not just the Narnian chronicles - but The Railway Children, all of Edward Eager's books on the children who find magic, the Brontes, and Jane Austen, that part of my brain thought England the most beautiful place in the world. Thanks Frances Hodgson Burnett! Still, even though I'm not much of a tabloid reader I know I was influenced by the media when thinking about the Royal Family. My feelings have been altered after reading this book. The most affecting parts of this rather classic bildungsroman are about the poisonous press.

But is it worth the read, yes.I found many parts of it interesting, especially all the details of Royalty life.

And they were few and far between - I was surprised how much it was really just about him, his life and struggles. I even appreciated how little of the book was about the last few years of his life and the drama it has entailed. I have watched the interviews, series and read the articles so I didn’t need a novel about the controversy surrounding him, his family and their decisions.

Rating 1 out of 5,"Not good. I don’t know much about the Royals and didn’t have any preconceived notions about Harry but his story is not told in a way that makes him very likable. If he had someone assisting him in writing, they did a terrible job. His story is also not believable. It’s really hard to grasp how he can only afford to buy clothes as TJ Max on sale when he is taking trips for months at a time with his mates. It is admirable that he joined the army and became a helicopter pilot. Most of his story is talking about his feelings towards the British paparazzi and news papers. It does seem to capitalize on his beloved mother and her death likely caused by trying to get away from these same people. It also seems very unusual that a family who had such a tragedy would not have got counseling for him as a 12 year old.

Rating 4 out of 5,"“When is someone going to break free of this family and live.” A quote from the book that basically sums it up. This memoir was grossly about Harry setting the record straight. Parts of it felt very “woe is me” at times, but in the same respect I can’t imagine what it’s like to be a Royal where your entire life and every move is under a constant spotlight. Harry mentions his issues over the years have never been with the British Monarchy but with the press. It was interesting (but not surprising) to learn all the lies & rumors the press has published over the years even paying staff members for “information” or even a “story” that would make good press while other family members turned a blind eye to much of it. I definitely think birth order has a huge role in this family too….William definitely seems like the typical older brother, compliant, rule-follower, etc. Where Harry, the second born, is definitely a wild child, attention seeking at times but breaking barriers. :) Overall I enjoyed this memoir and the insight into the Royal family, his time in the military, and how his mother’s death has played a huge part into many of his decisions. I also respect Harry & Meghan for just wanting to “live a life his mother always wanted.”Show more",4,When is someone going to break free of this family and live A quote from the book that basically sums it up This memoir was grossly about Harry setting the record straight Parts of it felt very woe is me at times but in the same respect I cant imagine what its like to be a Royal where your entire life and every move is under a constant spotlight Harry mentions his issues over the years have never been with the British Monarchy but with the press It was interesting but not surprising to learn all the lies  rumors the press has published over the years even paying staff members for information or even a story that would make good press while other family members turned a blind eye to much of it I definitely think birth order has a huge role in this family tooWilliam definitely seems like the typical older brother compliant rulefollower etc Where Harry the second born is definitely a wild child attention seeking at times but breaking barriers  Overall I enjoyed this memoir and the insight into the Royal family his time in the military and how his mothers death has played a huge part into many of his decisions I also respect Harry  Meghan for just wanting to live a life his mother always wantedShow more
Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 ⭐️As anti-monarchy and anti-Camilla-and-Charles I could be biased but I quite enjoyed Spare. Some bits were a bit cringe, some seemed a bit “woe is me”, and Harry is still also pro-monarchy (boooo), but overall I thought this was an insightful and well written book. He really doesn’t hold back on how he was feeling and what he was thinking during certain points of his life, and it’s quite shocking to read about the family dynamic (both within the family and with the media) and the hoops members have to jump through for the tiniest things. I thoroughly enjoyed all the subtle digs at Camilla. Also: after reading I 100% think that William was the one to make the comments re: Archie’s skin colour and no one will change my mindShow more",3,35 As antimonarchy and antiCamillaandCharles I could be biased but I quite enjoyed Spare Some bits were a bit cringe some seemed a bit woe is me and Harry is still also promonarchy boooo but overall I thought this was an insightful and well written book He really doesnt hold back on how he was feeling and what he was thinking during certain points of his life and its quite shocking to read about the family dynamic both within the family and with the media and the hoops members have to jump through for the tiniest things I thoroughly enjoyed all the subtle digs at Camilla Also after reading I 100 think that William was the one to make the comments re Archies skin colour and no one will change my mindShow more
Rating 4 out of 5,"I didn't know what to expect from this book due to all the hype and views. My opinion is Harry wrote this as he said to clear the air. It certainly highlights family dysfunction and adds another layer of being one of the most scrutinized families in the world. It challenges our views of unconditional love as a parent, which is different in a royal family. My hope with this book is that Harry and Megan move on with creating and living their life. They can't fix the past but they can create a new future for their family. It's an interesting read, at times disjointed, but he did what he wanted to do, by sharing his side.

Rating 3 out of 5,"I have always felt a weird connection to William and Harry because they have reddish hair and lost their dynamic mother (whose style my mother emulated) at about the same age as me and my brother lost ours. The parts of this book about grieving and watching your other parent become a single parent were the best (and Harry clearly feels similarly about red hair because he literally said that’s why Ginger Spice was his favorite). However, he needed a more judicious editor. This could have been half as long and conveyed just as much, with a bit less cringe TMI and a bit more evolution and even insight into the royal world. The parts about how hard it was for him to be single at 32 as the most eligible bachelor in the world were particular painful. I was surprised because Open and Shoe Dog, by the same ghost writer, are absolutely fantastic start to finish. Maybe they pushed this out too quickly. Maureen Dowd’s review was my favorite.Show more",3,I have always felt a weird connection to William and Harry because they have reddish hair and lost their dynamic mother whose style my mother emulated at about the same age as me and my brother lost ours The parts of this book about grieving and watching your other parent become a single parent were the best and Harry clearly feels similarly about red hair because he literally said thats why Ginger Spice was his favorite However he needed a more judicious editor This could have been half as long and conveyed just as much with a bit less cringe TMI and a bit more evolution and even insight into the royal world The parts about how hard it was for him to be single at 32 as the most eligible bachelor in the world were particular painful I was surprised because Open and Shoe Dog by the same ghost writer are absolutely fantastic start to finish Maybe they pushed this out too quickly Maureen Dowds review was my favoriteShow more

Whether you agree with Harry and Meghan’s stance (I do) or think they’re traitors to the crown (I don’t), there’s no arguing this book is a publishing/pop culture MOMENT. A truly (mostly) fascinating look inside a remarkable life. Were there parts where I thought to myself “mmmm maybe should’ve left that out”? Yes— but they were more so related to things that didn’t move the story along (hello, penis frostbite) than his feud with his family. Overall, enjoyed this and am very happy to have read it.

Rating 4 out of 5,"When I started this audiobook, I was certain I was going to hate every minute of it, but I tried really hard to remain impartial.First thing: I really hope Harry narrates more audiobooks, as he is one of the very few I’ve ever heard that I could listen to hour after hour without tiring. Of course, he presents himself as he perceives himself, or how he wants he wants to be perceived. He definitely had a privileged upbringing and is clueless as to what is or isn’t normal behaviour for “normal people” (most of his friends also seemed from privileged backgrounds).However, the environment he came from is rather… unique… and twisted. Nothing new there, but something worth remembering.I definitely wouldn’t take his word as gospel, but it was well worth my time!Show more",4,When I started this audiobook I was certain I was going to hate every minute of it but I tried really hard to remain impartialFirst thing I really hope Harry narrates more audiobooks as he is one of the very few Ive ever heard that I could listen to hour after hour without tiring Of course he presents himself as he perceives himself or how he wants he wants to be perceived He definitely had a privileged upbringing and is clueless as to what is or isnt normal behaviour for normal people most of his friends also seemed from privileged backgroundsHowever the environment he came from is rather unique and twisted Nothing new there but something worth rememberingI definitely wouldnt take his word as gospel but it was well worth my timeShow more

Rating 4 out of 5,"I really wish there was more distance between this book and the Netflix series. The series, the coverage of the series, the coverage of this book, and the PR for this book all occurring in about a month made many parts of the book feel repetitive and “ok ok I get it!” I think a little breathing room would have really helped with this.But in a vacuum, I’m glad I read it and especially that I listened to the audiobook. Parts of it were kind of boring to me (most of the army stuff, sorry Harry) and parts i found really touching (the birth of his daughter, the death of his grandmother). Overall: relevant to my interests.My biggest takeaway is that this book is Harry’s truth. It’s not objective and I think that’s ok, but it’s important to keep in mind.Harry mentions throughout that his memory is unreliable, to the point that I had the thought pretty early on: “this book would be impossible to fact check.” Is this honesty or is this a brilliant way to avoid blame for any errors?

Talked about being the spare a lot which I know that's what the book is about and I know he's working towards not focusing on that too much, but he throws that around a lot.As always I thought the book was a little bit too long but it wasn't boring in any spots. I had some thoughts about when he talked about his brother. It would be interesting to hear the other side of the story although I know we never will because he's going to be king and anything that comes from him will be so carefully curated it would be useless.I hadn't watched the Oprah interview or watched the TV show that people keep talking about in the comments here so I went into this pretty blind I just knew the stuff I saw occasionally on televisionThe one thing missing was talking about his uncle andrew. He mentioned some once in passing but he's the spare for Charles. So I would have thought that maybe there would be some insight there from him but I can see why you would want to avoid him at all costs in this book. It's just that what that was one of the things that was missing. And I'm old enough to remember how they used to call him Randy Andy cuz he used to party just like Harold did. And then I read a book about Margaret and she was similar.

Honestly, my reaction is a mix of feeling bad for him and his brother, but also just in shock at how bizarre the rules are for all the ""royal protocol"" and their weird, co-dependent relationship with the press. The whole thing is just super weird to me. It's such an archaic institution. He has nothing for himself. Like, he has all this education but by his own admission is not a great scholar, has all this privilege, but at the end of the day is at his dad's mercy for money as a grown 30 year old man. The only things he can really call his own are his wife and kids and his military service. The palace lays claim to everything else he is and was until he left. It did not escape my attention that a lot of the things he focused on in the book are the things that the press got wrong, things he was trying to explain the other side of. He's at the mercy of the press even now, still. I admire him for leaving and putting his own chosen family first. There were some things left out that I would have liked to have learned more about.

Rating 4 out of 5,"This was a genuinely fascinating, riveting memoir to both read and listen to. I will say, hearing the words from the man himself truly adds to the experience, more than reading it on the page. I was worried about Prince Harry fatigue going into this, but I think the framing of “here’s why I left” at the start makes this a clear, focused narrative. It is immensely clear that Harry was on this trajectory since August 1997. And it’s clear that the royal family is full of repressed, traumatized people. Of course they’re not going to gel with the one who actually commits to therapy and change! From his lonely childhood, to his harrowing experience at war, to his dedication to the safety of his family, this book gave me an in-depth look at a complicated person. Now I just need him to keep working on those mommy issues, pretty please. And for the record, if he ever needs a career pivot, he’d make an amazing romance novel narrator.

His story is so easy to digest because it's almost written as a series of short snippet stories as chapters which is realistically how our memories work. While yes you're getting the story one sided (as all biographies are) and therefore you must take it with a grain of salt, he is so up front on even the things that don't put him in the most positive light.I am obsessed. I have even more respect for him and Meg as we hear the story they weren't allowed to tell even though it ultimately was only a fraction of his story.

Rating 4 out of 5,"Glad to meet you, Harry. I was very pleasantly surprised to find the book was not rife with family grievances, although he did share his side of the story. People ask, if he doesn't want media attention then why put it all out there? Growing up in the royal family, he was taught ""never complain, never explain"", but once he had a wife and kids to protect, I understand why he needed to push back on the years of lies pushed by the media to sell stories, and even to explain to his own family where he was coming from. Harry and Meghan never intended to leave the family, they were only trying to pull back from hurtful media scrutiny while continuing the Queen's work. The family (or The Firm) proved their lack of empathy by completely cutting them out, making the ""problem"" go away. Which exactly proves his point. Most of the book was dedicated to both his struggles and successes growing up after the death of his beloved mother, Diana. I found it a very touching, sometimes heartbreaking read, but also peppered with that British humour I so love.Show more",4,Glad to meet you Harry I was very pleasantly surprised to find the book was not rife with family grievances although he did share his side of the story People ask if he doesnt want media attention then why put it all out there Growing up in the royal family he was taught never complain never explain but once he had a wife and kids to protect I understand why he needed to push back on the years of lies pushed by the media to sell stories and even to explain to his own family where he was coming from Harry and Meghan never intended to leave the family they were only trying to pull back from hurtful media scrutiny while continuing the Queens work The family or The Firm proved their lack of empathy by completely cutting them out making the problem go away Which exactly proves his point Most of the book was dedicated to both his struggles and successes growing up after the death of his beloved mother Diana I found it a very touching sometimes heartbreaking read but also peppered with that British humour I so loveShow more

Rating 2 out of 5,"The things I do for Meghan... Let me start by saying the sole reason I bought this (ebook version because there's no way I'd have a physical copy of this on my shelf with him staring into my soul) is because of my utmost respect for her. I've been a fan of hers (mainly from Suits) since before she became involved in the complete joke that is the Royal Family, and quite frankly, after all the baseless hate, I've become an even bigger fan of hers. Supporting Harry = supporting Meghan and I'll do just about anything to support her.Let's get into my thoughts on the book itself. The first 60% bore. me. to. near death. Not to mention there were certain bits of info I could've gone my entire life without knowing (if you've read this, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about). I also wasn't a fan of the writing. I'm not sure who his ghostwriter was, but it was obvious which parts Harry had a heavy hand in and which parts the ghostwriter took a little creative liberty with. I definitely appreciated his take on his mother's untimely and very unfortunate death, as well as his showing how that grief stuck with him throughout his life before he finally found a therapist to help him work through it. However, this wasn't able to overshadow my issues with the memoir as a whole. Having said all this, I sympathize with him over how vile the British media has been and continues to be. The American media leaves a lot to be desired, but in comparison to the Brits, American magazine editors/writers look almost angelic.I'll close with a quote from one of my favorite TV show characters, Leslie Knope:""Freedom of the press is for the birds!""*Upon reflection, a 2.5 was me being too generous, so I'm dropping this down to an even 2.Show more",2,The things I do for Meghan Let me start by saying the sole reason I bought this ebook version because theres no way Id have a physical copy of this on my shelf with him staring into my soul is because of my utmost respect for her Ive been a fan of hers mainly from Suits since before she became involved in the complete joke that is the Royal Family and quite frankly after all the baseless hate Ive become an even bigger fan of hers Supporting Harry  supporting Meghan and Ill do just about anything to support herLets get into my thoughts on the book itself The first 60 bore me to near death Not to mention there were certain bits of info I couldve gone my entire life without knowing if youve read this youll know exactly what Im talking about I also wasnt a fan of the writing Im not sure who his ghostwriter was but it was obvious which parts Harry had a heavy hand in and which parts the ghostwriter took a little creative liberty with I definitely appreciated his take on his mothers untimely and very unfortunate death as well as his showing how that grief stuck with him throughout his life before he finally found a therapist to help him work through it However this wasnt able to overshadow my issues with the memoir as a whole Having said all this I sympathize with him over how vile the British media has been and continues to be The American media leaves a lot to be desired but in comparison to the Brits American magazine editorswriters look almost angelicIll close with a quote from one of my favorite TV show characters Leslie KnopeFreedom of the press is for the birdsUpon reflection a 25 was me being too generous so Im dropping this down to an even 2Show more

Rating 2 out of 5,"Intensely strange simulacra of a confessional. Ghostwriters terribly conjure together some adolescent schema concerning big scary words like ‘trauma’, ‘defence mechanisms’ etc. about Prince Harry’s childhood. Eye rolling platitudinal phrases liberally inserted into nearly every sentence, tiny chapters to hold the attention of the barely literate masses (okay that bit is a joke). There’s something profoundly wrong with this autobiography, almost nauseating (and I’m not referring to the ‘cheeky boy, aren’t we all the fackin’ same at the end of the bleedin’ day’ condescension that this book revels in) but instead the inherent distance of the writing itself, the entire time you’re constantly aware that Harry likely did not write a single line of this unnecessarily long book but yet attempts to frame it as such. Some very cringeworthy sections about ‘Oh God I loved my childhood stories of our boys fighting off those pesky Zulus but I must have simply filtered out all of the colonial intent behind said war *dum dadada* until now!!! Now I know my family’s heritage is an disgrace in that regard’ blah blah fucking blah. If you look below there are plenty more examples I’ve pointed out of this utter shite, these lines demarcating the site where literature goes to die. At one point Harry has the gall to call out an article about him for its, and I’m quoting the precise, intricate phrasing of this point, so bear with me folks — ‘shitty writing’. Fella have you even read this trashhhhh that has your own name under it? In another mention of literature, describing himself as part of the ‘Shakespeareless masses’, he says how much he admired Of Mice and Men and saw his relation with his older, heir-to-the-throne brother in it. Was this an unsubtle stab by the (ghost-)author to call Harry an out and out retard without having the balls to explicitly state it? I’m not the greatest at hermeneutics, but I’m siding with yes. The final third is your bog standard dramatic biography stuff, which I didn’t particularly mind. However, its lack of sheer awfulness kinda took the fun out of the whole thing. Just kind of reading sensationalist melodrama, with Harry pointedly shaping the narrative into a middle finger toward the entire monarchy (of course all the while stating that the taxpayer only pays the price of a pint to keep them going each year - no advocacy of Republicanism sadly). Below I’ve gathered together some of most awful quotes, aside from that BrainyQuote.com section concerning Faulkner which is currently doing the rounds on social media - that part is admittedly terrible. But these are also nearly as bad:-‘What idiots we were, thinking we could change. Pass the spliff mate.’-‘Cows need their space.I felt them.’ (Harry elucidating the sheer abject depression he suffered herding cattle in Australia, I don’t even think some of the worst Nu Metal bands could pen something so awful.)-Explains how ‘page three girl’ was an ‘accepted, misogynistic, objectifying term’ (I found this to be a very nuanced take, cheers Harry.)-‘They can’t break me, I thought. Is it, I wondered, because I’m already broken?’ (The context for this is his experience of military boot camp.)-‘Lack of genetic diversity was nothing compared to press gaslighting. Marrying your cousin is far less dicey than becoming a profit center for Murdoch Inc.’(Need I really say more?)-‘What was the universe out to prove by taking my penis at the same moment it took my brother?’-‘[we] watched… Inside Out.

Rating 1 out of 5,"Harry and his wife are traitors, to each of their families, and the British people.

Rating 5 out of 5,"One of the best books I've ever read. I am SO glad I listened to this on audio, narrated by Prince Harry himself. I went into this blind and with a very different opinion than I am left with. I wasn't even a ""fan"", if you will, of the Monarchy, nor did I know much about it other than watching 4 seasons of The Crown. However, I (naively) believed public opinion of Harry's and Meghan's intentions. Oh how VERY wrong I was. After 16 hours with Harry I feel like he is my friend and I'm sad to see this book end. I'm genuinely happy that he has Meghan and his children in his life. All Harry ever wanted in life was to love his family and to be loved by his family. But they couldn't do it. No one ever hugged him as a child, not even when his mother died. Being called ""Darling Boy"" by his father was the most affection he was ever shown. How dreadfully sad. The Press are wretched people. This book makes me embarrassed that I've even clicked on articles about famous people. I also now doubt everything I've ever seen as fact, including statements published by the Crown, considering a ""signed statement"" that Harry had never seen nor approved was published as his and William's words.If you choose to read the book, choose the audio. You will have a totally different experience hearing him tell his story. You will know that he is authentic, you will know that his number of 25 killed in Afghanistan isn't bragging but accountability (and how it affects his soul), you will hear the emotion when he speaks of his struggles with mental health as well as his delights in his love story with Meghan. I hope Harry publishes another book and also narrates it. I couldn't get enough of this. I woke up thinking about it and was simply fascinated by it all.Show more",5,One of the best books Ive ever read I am SO glad I listened to this on audio narrated by Prince Harry himself I went into this blind and with a very different opinion than I am left with I wasnt even a fan if you will of the Monarchy nor did I know much about it other than watching 4 seasons of The Crown However I naively believed public opinion of Harrys and Meghans intentions Oh how VERY wrong I was After 16 hours with Harry I feel like he is my friend and Im sad to see this book end Im genuinely happy that he has Meghan and his children in his life All Harry ever wanted in life was to love his family and to be loved by his family But they couldnt do it No one ever hugged him as a child not even when his mother died Being called Darling Boy by his father was the most affection he was ever shown How dreadfully sad The Press are wretched people This book makes me embarrassed that Ive even clicked on articles about famous people I also now doubt everything Ive ever seen as fact including statements published by the Crown considering a signed statement that Harry had never seen nor approved was published as his and Williams wordsIf you choose to read the book choose the audio You will have a totally different experience hearing him tell his story You will know that he is authentic you will know that his number of 25 killed in Afghanistan isnt bragging but accountability and how it affects his soul you will hear the emotion when he speaks of his struggles with mental health as well as his delights in his love story with Meghan I hope Harry publishes another book and also narrates it I couldnt get enough of this I woke up thinking about it and was simply fascinated by it allShow more

Rating 5 out of 5,"I have never been invested in the lives of the royal family. I did pick this book up because of how much people talked about it. I've read a handful of other reviews and the negative ones clearly drew the line at a dislike for him and Meghan or the royal family all together. ""But the kill count he mentions.."" Yes, about that, he states that he was instructed by the palace to tell the press 10 years ago when he was still in service. He is not breaching security or safety at this point. His relationship with his family imploded because they were embarrassed by him and decided it was easier to cut him off than to accept responsibility for their own part. I think it was well versed, well thought out and exactly what he meant to put out into the world. This is Prince Harry's chance to change his own narrative. I have no idea how he has such grace through it. I would have thrown up two middle fingers and spilled all the tea. The theme for Prince Harry throughout the book seems to be wanting to have a life that isn't entirely political. He wants to live and not have half the world tell him he's Satan for doing so. I have nothing but respect for a man that is willing to leave a literal castle of gold for the chance at a life. I really love how much he talks about counseling and how it's helped him be a better version of himself. A) men have a much harder time seeking therapy and accepting help and B) the rest of your dysfunctional family doesn't have the same broken power over you when you become a healed individual. That's what's happened here. His devolved father and brother could use some therapy before attempting to share their thoughts on what Harry is or isn't doing properly. The lack of support he has had his entire life really makes it awe inspiring that he has grown to be the man that he is.The paparazzi is another huge part of this book. I understand completely how he didn't choose to grow up in this image and how it emotionally damaged him and his family. I see how there aren't enough regulations and rules about what is acceptable behavior from them. Separate from the book, the royal family is vile. And choosing child abusers over interracial family members. They're basically a southern republican. 🤮I have so many more thoughts on this book but need to sit with it for a bit.

I thought I would know everything in this book. Wrong! Reading about Harry’s life in his words was, in turn, incredibly sad and uplifting. Harry was a lost little boy who wanted to escape but didn’t know how. His love for Meghan opened his eyes to what was possible in life and impossible with family. I know it’s only one side of the story, but I believe in the awfulness of the press and the unwillingness of the palace to help.

Rating 3 out of 5,"Spare has some wildest sales of any memoir in recent memory. Over 5,000 people were behind me in the line for Toronto Public Library's audiobook copies. For comparison, Bono's memoir had the next-highest wait list I've seen to date and that was about +400 people. Is it worth the hype? Let's dig in.What I found engaging: - Harry's lifelong struggle to process a terrible personal loss with minimal support. Mental health really was a different animal in the 80s and 90s and while he doesn't give any of that context, I could fill in the gaps because I lived through a traumatic death in the same time period without support (smaller scale, but still). The people around him did him no favours by not actively helping him to process what had happened.- The schism between the princes. Like many people, I believed the PR story that they were glued at the hip. It's clear that Harry loves his brother (and that William loves him) but the breach is considerable and long-standing. I wish there was more acknowledgement that William is also living through his own public trauma. People process hard things differently. - The tension between Prince Charles as a father doing his best he can with the tools that he has and the monarch-in-waiting whose self-aggrandizement prompts him to throw his sons to the wolves to protect his own image, particularly after Camilla formally rolls into the scene.- Harry's longing for marriage and family as a path to achieving full-royal status. Society teaches us it's women who think this way and his candour on this front was interesting.- His efforts to find a connection to work after retiring from the military, and the resulting pathway to the Invictus Games. - The inability of the British monarchy--some of the richest people on the planet--to think about PR with an abundant mindset. As any stint in academia will show you, scarcity thinking turns people into jackals. Where it's lacking:- Great memoirs give you a sense of the people around the narrator: their dynamics and their relationships over time. Bono's memoir, which I also read this month, does this well. Harry's memoir is focused on his internal journey. He has little insight to offer about anyone except Charles and Meghan. - It's perhaps unfair to expect a soldier to take a broad geopolitical view, but Harry is also a prince. His discussion of 9/11 and the occupation of Afghanistan in the years following misses the West's role in creating the Taliban and the pitfalls of interventionist/colonialist thinking in the 20th century.- Minimal discussion of racism as an inherent part of the British Monarchy or his own views changing with regard to Meghan's presence in his life. It's glossed over in a way I found surprising given the Oprah interview and other coverage the Sussexes have led. - A one-sided view of the press as paparazzi, which is understandable, but reads as naive. His mother was an excellent manipulator of the press as a whole and the monarchy benefits greatly from the relationship. Harry is understandably focused on its negative impacts (the photo stalking is disgusting and unacceptable). I found the descriptions of the dynamic one-sided and not as clear as I was expecting, given other reviews, about how the system actually works. He is clear about where his family failed to protect them and what he wanted to be different. - Falling into the trap of repeating 'we said/they said' conversations without as much effort to pull back and reflect on the bigger dynamics behind his conflicts with William/Kate, Charles/Camilla, and the Queen's PR henchmen. It may be that he still doesn't know, but this approach shifts the book into a scoresheet and a less satisfying reading experience. The editorial team let him down here by not prompting him to look deeper.- Minimal acknowledgement of how rare it is to grow up seeing as much of the world as Harry has, and of being framed as an 'important person' in all of those experiences. No, he didn't ask for it. But he has benefitted from it all the same. Given the misinformation printed about Harry across his life without his control, I respect his decision to tell his own story, come what may. I found myself wondering how this book would read if it had been written when Harry was 50 with some time and distance to lengthen his perspective. I got the sense the wounds beneath the schism remain very fresh. With Spare out in the world ahead of his father's coronation, it's hard to see any way in which Harry's exile from his family will ever end. Perhaps that was the point.Show more",3,Spare has some wildest sales of any memoir in recent memory Over 5000 people were behind me in the line for Toronto Public Librarys audiobook copies For comparison Bonos memoir had the nexthighest wait list Ive seen to date and that was about 400 people Is it worth the hype Lets dig inWhat I found engaging  Harrys lifelong struggle to process a terrible personal loss with minimal support Mental health really was a different animal in the 80s and 90s and while he doesnt give any of that context I could fill in the gaps because I lived through a traumatic death in the same time period without support smaller scale but still The people around him did him no favours by not actively helping him to process what had happened The schism between the princes Like many people I believed the PR story that they were glued at the hip Its clear that Harry loves his brother and that William loves him but the breach is considerable and longstanding I wish there was more acknowledgement that William is also living through his own public trauma People process hard things differently  The tension between Prince Charles as a father doing his best he can with the tools that he has and the monarchinwaiting whose selfaggrandizement prompts him to throw his sons to the wolves to protect his own image particularly after Camilla formally rolls into the scene Harrys longing for marriage and family as a path to achieving fullroyal status Society teaches us its women who think this way and his candour on this front was interesting His efforts to find a connection to work after retiring from the military and the resulting pathway to the Invictus Games  The inability of the British monarchysome of the richest people on the planetto think about PR with an abundant mindset As any stint in academia will show you scarcity thinking turns people into jackals Where its lacking Great memoirs give you a sense of the people around the narrator their dynamics and their relationships over time Bonos memoir which I also read this month does this well Harrys memoir is focused on his internal journey He has little insight to offer about anyone except Charles and Meghan  Its perhaps unfair to expect a soldier to take a broad geopolitical view but Harry is also a prince His discussion of 911 and the occupation of Afghanistan in the years following misses the Wests role in creating the Taliban and the pitfalls of interventionistcolonialist thinking in the 20th century Minimal discussion of racism as an inherent part of the British Monarchy or his own views changing with regard to Meghans presence in his life Its glossed over in a way I found surprising given the Oprah interview and other coverage the Sussexes have led  A onesided view of the press as paparazzi which is understandable but reads as naive His mother was an excellent manipulator of the press as a whole and the monarchy benefits greatly from the relationship Harry is understandably focused on its negative impacts the photo stalking is disgusting and unacceptable I found the descriptions of the dynamic onesided and not as clear as I was expecting given other reviews about how the system actually works He is clear about where his family failed to protect them and what he wanted to be different  Falling into the trap of repeating we saidthey said conversations without as much effort to pull back and reflect on the bigger dynamics behind his conflicts with WilliamKate CharlesCamilla and the Queens PR henchmen It may be that he still doesnt know but this approach shifts the book into a scoresheet and a less satisfying reading experience The editorial team let him down here by not prompting him to look deeper Minimal acknowledgement of how rare it is to grow up seeing as much of the world as Harry has and of being framed as an important person in all of those experiences No he didnt ask for it But he has benefitted from it all the same Given the misinformation printed about Harry across his life without his control I respect his decision to tell his own story come what may I found myself wondering how this book would read if it had been written when Harry was 50 with some time and distance to lengthen his perspective I got the sense the wounds beneath the schism remain very fresh With Spare out in the world ahead of his fathers coronation its hard to see any way in which Harrys exile from his family will ever end Perhaps that was the pointShow more

Rating 3 out of 5,"Oh darling boy, there's a lot to unpack here. As I listened to the audiobook, I jotted down musings and rants, but as Harry's story came to a close, I focused more on listening to his words and I must say, some of my previous thoughts and opinions have changed for the better.To preface, I have preconceived notions about all parties but have not seen the Oprah interview or the Netflix series and I am American, so thus, had not fully engaged in any of the royal drama (at least until it started popping up everywhere in the final quarter of 2022).This reads unfortunately, much more like a biography than I was expecting - at least until the last 4th of the book. I thought perhaps there would be more raw emotional content, but Prince Harry is – as he was taught to be – very closed off from his emotional state. Even then though, we are not privy to his innermost thoughts and feelings. We are mere observers, and he keeps us at a distance. It is a 'memoir', so thus we go through the ebb and flow of the Prince’s life, which at times can be a bit dull (army) and interesting (north pole) but doesn’t really get personal and ‘revelatory’ until 66% in – or when we hit “Part 3” which is, of course, when he meets Meghan and gets a solid therapist. Firstly, I honestly did not hear any ""shocking revelations"" or whatever else the press is trying to say. Anyone with an ounce of sense could probably surmise some of the things that are ""revealed"" here. However, what I did find surprising was how Charles and William came across.I didn't have a good impression of Charles and was expecting a cold and calculated man who barely acknowledges his children, but instead got these genuine hints of a sensitive loving father underneath the austere exterior. However, there are definite moments when he is self-absorbed and, along with Camilla, has a need to be drenched in the spotlight and for adoration. There are even some heavy hints that Charles and Camilla have an aide who gives out damaging information/lies to the press about other family members to distract from their own foibles. Which I must say is not that surprising.. William, on the other hand is not given such a gracious portrayal. There is obvious resentment from both parties brewing under the guise of brotherly love. I even question by the end if they ever really had a loving relationship. To be fair, it's not clear because it all seems like a tug-of-war of status. At some points Harry makes peace with ""being the spare"" and his position but at others he takes steps back – alarmed at how unfair things are. Through Harry’s eyes William is an egocentric taker. If Harry has something (Africa?! The entire continent???), William wants it. I found that section so tone-deaf and bizarre as it fully showcases their white privilege and isn’t flattering for them or the monarchy.Not only is there an emotion disconnect with his audience, but there is also a huge one with his family. Now, Harry writes this book through a lens of bias - after being persecuted by the media and systematically ejected from his family, the monarchy. An institution which is already clouded with its own customs, protocols, and biases. Thus, from the moment his mum dies, a wedge is created–where there is a lack of communication or over-communication but not empathy. Losing his mum at such a young age has created this disconnect between the family dynamic where Harry was splintered off in his own world – becoming this ‘other’ who floats between wanting a normal life and a royal life with obligations. Was the royal family always so distant? Weren’t there moments when they were close? We really don't get many instances explaining this - except broadly that none of the family are good with feelings or shows of affection and haven't been for many generations. But it seems there are more times showing familial strife than comfort, which skews our perception. Is Harry an unreliable narrator? In truth, he does only tell us what HE wants US to know. But there are moments when real gratitude and love shine through in his words about his family, so that's something.In some sections, Harry genuinely asks “why” of the customs of his family (in one section even becomes aghast at the idea he should ask his grandmother, the queen, for permission to marry - like isn't this something you should already be aware of that might be asked of you? Did they make this up? Were you not paying attention in monarchy class?) and true, you should ask why. But to subvert those expectations whenever you want can be seen as intrinsically disrespectful. His entire life, Harry is on the cusp. He tries to skirt this line between the monarchy and a 'normal life'. There are sections where he is far from the monarchy, either with the army, his friends, in a separate country, where he gives us the impression that he is living out his fantasy of a normal life. However, he is NEVER without bodyguards. Even when trying to live off the land briefly or immerse himself in another culture, this man cannot live a normal life due to the circumstances of his birth. He gets so comfortable with outside norms that when he plunges back into his duty to the monarchy, he is not able to re-conform to the rigid ideals. I think he forgets that as the spare, he is given the luxury of not having to conform day in and day out like his father and William. He travels, he leads a military nomadic life. I can honestly see why his family would bristle at any hint of complaint and treat it as disrespect because they have to put up with these royal standards every day and he doesn't.That's not to say he shouldn't challenge societal norms - well monarchal norms. He just has to be the first one to do it and it's scary to be the first one to go out on a limb without any security (literally, his problem is wanting security and guards constantly-which seems like a solution he could fix easily by hiring ex-military friends or something, but he only contacts the palace about such matters, and they rebuff him). In living the normal life he wants to live, he must forgo all the things that made his former life so easy, and I don’t know that he fully was ready for the implications of that, especially when he complains about not having any employable skills, which he blames on his family, but part of that fault is also with him. I’m not surprised that the public is dragging him because it’s something he should have seen coming. You cannot have your cake and eat it too so it goes.Ultimately though, the big bad in all this - the raging antagonist - is the press and media conglomeration. I find Harry is totally justified in his smear of the press throughout the book. Absolutely no one should be subjected to that kind of torture from the media. From their involvement with Diana’s crash to the printed lies and lazy journalism, it begs the question, why does the royal family need to provide the press any access at all into their private lives? If they don’t give them access, the press goes on a smear campaign becoming increasingly viler– regardless of the person they target. The less they know, the more they seem to print. It makes sense why Charles puts himself in the spotlight. To him, a calculated news brief means you know precisely what’s being said about you. He has obviously learned over his long life what to do to appease the media. That doesn’t mean it’s not disgusting, but he’s playing the game, a game that Harry has never wanted to play. “The more disheartening response was from my family. Silence. They never commented publicly, never said anything privately to me... I’d always told myself that just because everyone in my family didn’t explicitly condemn press attacks, it didn’t mean they condoned them. But now I ask, is that true? How do I know? If they never say anything, why do I so often assume that I know how they feel, and that they’re unequivocally on our side? Everything that I’ve been taught, everything that I’ve grown up believing about the family and about the monarchy, about its essential fairness, its job of uniting rather than dividing, was being undermined, called into question. Was it all fake? Was it all just a show?... Isn’t defending each other the first rule of every family?”The motto of the royal family has been for some time: never complain, never explain. This is where I have uncertain opinions. Harry purports occasionally that the firm knows how to spin things with the media. Each faction of the family has their own spin doctors and sources. I don't think we, as readers and outsiders, know the truth. Even if that were true, there are so many instances where the palace has been quiet about matters, they have a well-known history of being quiet, and not commenting. It is baffling to me that Harry would just assume the palace would come out with a comment after every vile story or infraction at his or Meghan's expense. His protective instincts went overdrive in that regard and he hits self-absorption territory. Numerous things were written about Kate and Camila and his grandfather, but he said studies were done that showed evidence that Meghan was hounded even more unjustly than any of them (with often a remark about her race being the cause). He says this but does not show the empirical evidence. But on the other hand, should he have to show the evidence in his own memoir to justify his stance? Probably not. It just seems frustrating that if you grew up in this environment and around this mindset, why on earth would you expect things to be ANY different for you? Especially as an adult? There is a lot of time devoted in this book to complaining about how unfair the system is to him and his family. A system they created. In a way, he is just as self-absorbed as he portrays the rest of his family to be. He only truly cares about the media coverage when what is happening is fully affecting him - the same as the rest of them. I don't blame him for leaving this microcosm, and in fact, I now think it was likely the best choice for him considering how important he views personal safety, how much he despises the media, and the PTSD from the loss of his mother.I honestly hope someday he and his family can find peace with all this. The memoir seems written in haste and in some regard with fear and anger. There is a lot to be said, but I think Step 1 should be sitting down with all his feelings and getting to know them. Step 2 would be to stop reading anything from the media torrent that floods him daily. But I suppose, one step at a time in the journey toward personal growth, right?Show more",3,Oh darling boy theres a lot to unpack here As I listened to the audiobook I jotted down musings and rants

family has their own spin doctors and sources I dont think we as readers and outsiders know the truth Even if that were true there are so many instances where the palace has been quiet about matters they have a wellknown history of being quiet and not commenting It is baffling to me that Harry would just assume the palace would come out with a comment after every vile story or infraction at his or Meghans expense His protective instincts went overdrive in that regard and he hits selfabsorption territory Numerous things were written about Kate and Camila and his grandfather but he said studies were done that showed evidence that Meghan was hounded even more unjustly than any of them with often a remark about her race being the cause He says this but does not show the empirical evidence But on the other hand should he have to show the evidence in his own memoir to justify his stance Probably not It just seems frustrating that if you grew up in this environment and around this mindset why on earth would you expect things to be ANY different for you Especially as an adult There is a lot of time devoted in this book to complaining about how unfair the system is to him and his family A system they created In a way he is just as selfabsorbed as he portrays the rest of his family to be He only truly cares about the media coverage when what is happening is fully affecting him  the same as the rest of them I dont blame him for leaving this microcosm and in fact I now think it was likely the best choice for him considering how important he views personal safety how much he despises the media and the PTSD from the loss of his motherI honestly hope someday he and his family can find peace with all this The memoir seems written in haste and in some regard with fear and anger There is a lot to be said but I think Step 1 should be sitting down with all his feelings and getting to know them Step 2 would be to stop reading anything from the media torrent that floods him daily But I suppose one step at a time in the journey toward personal growth rightShow more

Rating 5 out of 5,"I truly can't put into words how I feel about Spare, but I will try my best. First, I have to start this review by saying that I love Prince Harry, and after reading Spare, I love him even more. I 110% support his and Meghan‘s relationship and the decisions they have made as a couple. I love them together and it's obvious that they are perfect for each other. I know that there has been some negative press about this book, and there are many royal fans who aren't happy about Harry writing this book. But for me, until you have walked in Harry's shoes, you should keep your negative opinions to yourself. You may not like it, but guess what, it's not your life NOR does it impact you in any way. It is mind-boggling to me that people can be so cruel and harsh just because they don't like a decision a person is making. People truly suck and I don't know why someone feels the need to sit behind a computer screen and bully and threaten someone. I understand that there are three sides to a story, but my heart truly broke for Harry while reading Spare. It was clear throughout the book that Harry was crying out and in pain, but no one seemed to listen or care. I understand that as a royal there is precedence but we are also in the 21st century, it’s time to loosen up and stop being so stiff. I could never imagine a world where someone controlled everything in my life, every decision I make, every move I make, etc. And how can you call yourself family, when you allow your staff to publish nasty and false stories about your children/grandchildren to make yourselves look better? Allowing this to continue has clearly torn the family apart. Add in the fact that the press has created a rivalry between Harry, William, and Charles. It's sad that the press could have such an impact on their personal and public lives that it would lead to them competing against each other and throwing each other under the bus for five minutes of personal gain. I truly do not know if Harry, William, and Charles's relationship will ever be amended. I also question if the relationship between William and Harry was ever good or if it's always been for show. As someone who has always had an obsession with the royal family, Spare opened my eyes to a lot. It also left a sour taste in my mouth about William and Charles. I can see why many want the monarchy to end. I also couldn't help but see that history was repeating itself when comparing Harry to Princess Margaret and Meghan to Princess Diana. You would think that the royal family would have learned from the lessons of the past and evolved, but clearly not. As I mentioned earlier, I truly can't express the impact Spare had on me. It honestly broke my heart in so many ways and I had so many emotions while reading this book. I hope that by Harry writing this book, he has been able to find some closure. I also wish nothing but the best for him and Meghan and hope that they can find peace. I may be biased, but if you have any interest in the royal family, I would highly recommend reading Spare!Show more",5,I truly cant put into words how I feel about Spare but I will try my best First I have to start this review by saying that I love Prince Harry and after reading Spare I love him even more I 110 support his and Meghans relationship and the decisions they have made as a couple I love them together and its obvious that they are perfect for each other I know that there has been some negative press about this book and there are many royal fans who arent happy about Harry writing this book But for me until you have walked in Harrys shoes you should keep your negative opinions to yourself You may not like it but guess what its not your life NOR does it impact you in any way It is mindboggling to me that people can be so cruel and harsh just because they dont like a decision a person is making People truly suck and I dont know why someone feels the need to sit behind a computer screen and bully and threaten someone I understand that there are three sides to a story but my heart truly broke for Harry while reading Spare It was clear throughout the book that Harry was crying out and in pain but no one seemed to listen or care I understand that as a royal there is precedence but we are also in the 21st century its time to loosen up and stop being so stiff I could never imagine a world where someone controlled everything in my life every decision I make every move I make etc And how can you call yourself family when you allow your staff to publish nasty and false stories about your childrengrandchildren to make yourselves look better Allowing this to continue has clearly torn the family apart Add in the fact that the press has created a rivalry between Harry William and Charles Its sad that the press could have such an impact on their personal and public lives that it would lead to them competing against each other and throwing each other under the bus for five minutes of personal gain I truly do not know if Harry William and Charless relationship will ever be amended I also question if the relationship between William and Harry was ever good or if its always been for show As someone who has always had an obsession with the royal family Spare opened my eyes to a lot It also left a sour taste in my mouth about William and Charles I can see why many want the monarchy to end I also couldnt help but see that history was repeating itself when comparing Harry to Princess Margaret and Meghan to Princess Diana You would think that the royal family would have learned from the lessons of the past and evolved but clearly not As I mentioned earlier I truly cant express the impact Spare had on me It honestly broke my heart in so many ways and I had so many emotions while reading this book I hope that by Harry writing this book he has been able to find some closure I also wish nothing but the best for him and Meghan and hope that they can find peace I may be biased but if you have any interest in the royal family I would highly recommend reading SpareShow more

Rating 3 out of 5,"I have to say, I feel for Prince Harry. I try to imagine being a kid growing up in his situation and I can't help but think it must have been absolutely dreadful. To lose his mother the way he did. To constantly have to be on display. Constantly in the public eye. Constantly scrutinized. Constant fodder for the press. To have absolutely no privacy at all. Every single mistake memorialized in newsprint forever. Everything he does, splattered all over the world news. Not allowed really to express emotion. I cannot fathom how hard that must be to deal with. I'm not sure I would retain a shred of sanity, were I in his position. And I'm thinking maybe he has had trouble keeping his. I don't doubt that all he has been through has left it's mark on his mental health. The PTSD and panic attacks that he acknowledges, either of those is difficult enough to live with in themselves. I actually admire him for putting a spotlight on those issues. I admit, I did get a little tired towards the end with all the focus on defending Meghan. I'm sure Meghan must have some culpability here, but we'll never really know because the other side is keeping mum.  This is not the most interesting memoir I've read. It's not that well written. But, I was a big fan of Princess Di, and I've always had a soft spot for Harry and William, so I had to read it. 3 stars.Show more",3,I have to say I feel for Prince Harry I try to imagine being a kid growing up in his situation and I cant help but think it must have been absolutely dreadful To lose his mother the way he did To constantly have to be on display Constantly in the public eye Constantly scrutinized Constant fodder for the press To have absolutely no privacy at all Every single mistake memorialized in newsprint forever Everything he does splattered all over the world news Not allowed really to express emotion I cannot fathom how hard that must be to deal with Im not sure I would retain a shred of sanity were I in his position And Im thinking maybe he has had trouble keeping his I dont doubt that all he has been through has left its mark on his mental health The PTSD and panic attacks that he acknowledges either of those is difficult enough to live with in themselves I actually admire him for putting a spotlight on those issues I admit I did get a little tired towards the end with all the focus on defending Meghan Im sure Meghan must have some culpability here but well never really know because the other side is keeping mum  This is not the most interesting memoir Ive read Its not that well written But I was a big fan of Princess Di and Ive always had a soft spot for Harry and William so I had to read it 3 starsShow more

Moehringer, who wrote ""The Tender Bar"" and has also won a Pulitzer for reporting) and equally as compelling as an audiobook. I fully buy Harry's version of events, but his depiction of Meghan is a little too glowing. She's made out to be too pure and perfect, and while I don't think she's the monster the British press has made her out to be, I also don't believe that she was quite that wide-eyed and naïve. At the same time though, I'd like to think my husband would describe me in those same glowing terms. I'm not a royal watcher by any means, but because the House of Windsor has been such a large part of pop culture throughout my life, right down to Princess Diana dying on my birthday, I couldn't not read this.

Rating 2 out of 5,"I’ve listened to the audio version of this book and found his voice quite soothing. I think listening to an author’s own story always makes for a better experience than just reading. I feel for the guy as a human being and wish him and his family well. So, These are the only pleasant points I can make about the author. I guess the book's point is commercial; to redeem himself from shenanigans in the past; reveal everything a press may have blackmailed him over; and showcase him as a man who challenged the institution and the game and paid a heavy price. The book itself I found repetitive in the content; a lot of references to his mother when it’s not necessary hence making it feel like he is exploiting her name and life(we know he is traumatised, his mother's son); too much time is spent on describing public places (we can all google them, the attempt to tell him from his perspective didn’t work, it felt like a tour); too much brand naming, which I can only assume for a commercial purpose otherwise why to say it?! He bashes the media for lies which I get, and admire. So, fairplay to him for standing up for himself it’s never easy. He also complains that they gave and give him and his family no privacy, but at the same time, in the book, he talks about his most private parts and moments. It makes me start to believe that he wants privacy not for security but for commercial purposes. Okay, it will cover his security cost, but seriously, some stuff should keep private. I didn’t need to know about his junk; instead, I would have loved to learn more about the relationships within the family in a bit more detail and more about his growth. PS. About Kazakhstan I know it’s true, I was there at the time but his year is wrong unless he did come back with his gf there again in 2019?! Or he is just bad with dates. If you have ever watched any documentary about him and meg, don’t waste your money/time on this book; you won’t learn anything new about him except that he has a circumcised penis, had a frostbitten penis, lost his virginity to a MILF behind a pub and maybe didn’t stop using drugs until he met Meg.

Rating 1 out of 5,"First of all I don’t condone anyone who loves this book. I’m not here to change anyones mind. We can always agree to disagree respectfully. I can understand anyone who sympathized with Harry. It was traumatizing to loose your mom at a very young age. But let us not forget that Prince William suffers too. And look what is Harry doing to his own brother.I may not be as rich as Harry. I mean he made £16million for his memoir Spare after making £109million in Spotify and Netflix deals by trashing the royal family. I’m a dirt poor compared to him. But there is no amount of money in this world that will make me sell out my own family. I value my family no matter how imperfect we are. Loyalty is everything to me. There is something about betrying family members that sickens me but doing it for profit put them to another level. There will always someone we love who will make us miserable. Brother, sister, parents, a friend or a spouse. I call it reality. I call it life.There are so many lies and contradiction in this book that made me question if Harry is a reliable narrator.The funny thing is that he maintains he loves and wants to reconcile with his family. But then he goes out telling the world the intimate details and private moments involving his family which absolutely betrays their trust the most. The deepest cuts are actually the smallest, the harshest blows the most off-hand.Harry is cruel.And think the reason why they are so desparate to reconcile with the royal family to the point of blackmailing them about book 2 is that they needed the royal clout.Without it, Harry and Megan are NOTHING.Irrelevant. 👑👑👑👑👑👑I’m not kidding. I think I’m traumatized🤣I have read dark and fucked up book before but Harry’s book left me scarred for life.This is the last time I’m going to read a memoir. I’m gonna stick to romance and will definitely try mystery/ suspense here and there.I’m the type of reader who doesn’t believe everything that she read especially if its deragatory to someone else. After reading Tom Bowers Revenge book (which is phenomenal) I felt compelled to read this book because I believed that there are two sides in every story.But unlike Tom Bowers who has all the receipts and proofs, this book is just pages and pages of whining and victimhood. OTT flowery words which I find pretentious, lies and contradiction from his previous claims. I don’t know why he and Megan lies so much when everything can be easily debunk online.TBH, I felt kinda bad for Harry before reading this book. I thought he really was a victim.

Rating 2 out of 5,"Wow, this book is not good. Just imagine having the balls to spill your family's deepest darkest secrets and that's what Harry's terrible ghost writer does for him in 'Spare.' It is not well written or well told. I do have some sympathy for him and Meghan like they have no privacy...but this book hasn't helped with that, at all. If you crave privacy, it seems simple, stay out of the limelight for a few years. Don't give the press more sensationalised headlines by writing a tell-all.I get that everyone has the right to tell their story in their words and in some ways it is similar to how Diana put her narrative out there against the royal family but she just seemed so young and so genuine. Harry is older and should be wiser but there are some truly cringe moments in this autobiography...like his physical altercations with his brother and don't even get me started on his frozen penis. Like, honestly, 'spare' me the details.Show more",2,Wow this book is not good Just imagine having the balls to spill your familys deepest darkest secrets and thats what Harrys terrible ghost writer does for him in Spare It is not well written or well told I do have some sympathy for him and Meghan like they have no privacybut this book hasnt helped with that at all If you crave privacy it seems simple stay out of the limelight for a few years Dont give the press more sensationalised headlines by writing a tellallI get that everyone has the right to tell their story in their words and in some ways it is similar to how Diana put her narrative out there against the royal family but she just seemed so young and so genuine Harry is older and should be wiser but there are some truly cringe moments in this autobiographylike his physical altercations with his brother and dont even get me started on his frozen penis Like honestly spare me the detailsShow more
Rating 4 out of 5,"I really enjoyed the conversational tone of the book - it made it very easy to read and I found Prince Harry relatable because of it. I found his life stories to be interesting, and I can really understand why a life in the spotlight that you never asked for can be damaging and painful. My only problem was his assumptions on WHY people behaved certain ways. He would do this often, mostly about his brother and father - when there was an altercation or behavior that disappointed him, he wouldn’t hypothesize about their reasons. He would state the reasons for their behavior (ie, he was jealous, he wanted this issue to belong to him alone, etc) as facts, which is a bit unfair in my opinion. Overall, I really enjoyed reading the book and feel like he told his story well.

Rating 3 out of 5,"I hate it when other people’s complete lack of fairness and cherry-picking of facts forces me to defend people I am lukewarm or indifferent about. This is one of those times.  I’m not into celebrity gossip. I have never in my life purchased copy of OK! or Us Weekly or any other such rag. I am interested, however, in memoirs. I’ve read many reviews of this book both here on Goodreads and elsewhere, and those that rate it poorly consistently describe it as “boring.” That’s a bit too subjective an assessment to really argue against, I suppose; boredom is the eye of the beholder. Prince Harry’s musings rang true to me, they felt authentic, partly because they were at times rather mundane and meandering – what others may call boring I call “realistic.” Life isn’t always action-packed. I wonder if folks in the “it was boring” camp are perhaps unaccustomed to reading memoirs. Certainly, there are a lot of readers who seem to be confused about what a memoir is. A memoir is not a biography. A memoir is not an autobiography. A memoir is a book of personal ruminations and memories with a theme, usually revolving around a particular period of time. Criticism that this memoir “leaves things out” or “only tells one side” indicates a fundamental lack of understanding about the genre. I read this as a coming-of-age story. I saw aspects of many people I know and have known in my life: an emotionally neglected child of wealthy and often absent parents; a kid traumatized by the death of a parent at an early age; a second-born of whom little was expected; the not-as-smart sibling; acting out for attention and pushing boundaries as a teen; freshly-graduated, from a well-known and well-to-do family and thus forever in the shadow of the family name; directionless trust fund baby; idiot whiteboy; young dumb and full of ---. These are the flaws one ought to have expected given the author, the context, and the subject matter. I find it distasteful when people deny the pain or dismiss the experiences of others because “I had it so much worse!” or because “He was rich beyond all reason - he has no right to complain!” To withhold basic empathy from all but the most tragic and downtrodden, to have in place some arbitrary threshold that must be reached for someone else’s pain to be understood and acknowledged as valid, is to not understand what empathy is. Everything is relative, including emotional and psychological pain and trauma.The reviews of this book are fascinating! Particularly the negative ones. Fully one third of the most negative reviews (1 star) I read here admitted to not having read the book, and I expect the actual percentage is far higher. As soon as they use the word “narcissistic” or refer to “body language experts” (LOL!), I know they are not expressing an opinion they’ve come to in good faith; they are just regurgitating nationalist monarchist talking points and/or using their “reviews” of the book as an opportunity to be petty and abusive for sport. For a group of people who claim to hate the evil media, rightwing reactionaries sure love to vomit up every negative thing that same evil media has “reported” about Harry and Meghan! The good part of this is that it’s easy to spot.Many people who have reviewed this book have characterized Harry as being emotionally immature. In other breaking news: water is wet. Of course he is immature. Did you expect an English Prince to be otherwise? I just feel like the metrics are completely off with people who would say this. His experience of life was/is in no way “normal.” He enjoyed the kind of privilege that only a small handful of people in all of human history have ever enjoyed. He’s a PRINCE. Then when he was 12 his mother died – suddenly and violently – and he was left to deal with that pretty much on his own. Folks readily acknowledge all this, harp on it even, and then in the same breath decry the fact that his personal and emotional development appear to be somewhat delayed or impaired. ALL of these people (Royals) are impaired. I laughed out loud at a review on here that said something to the effect of “Willy had the same upbringing and he turned out fine.” The King-to-be boffed his wife’s friend, which based on the timing seems very likely to be the real reason they decided to throw Meghan and Harry to the wolves. Willy is not fine. The Monarchy wants us to think he’s fine, but he’s not. He can’t be. It is objectively impossible for him to be “fine.” I will die on this hill. Throughout his entire life, King Charles never traveled without his childhood teddy bear; the teddy bear had its own valet. Girl. These men are NOT okay. It’s giving Citizen Kane without any of the achievements or success or political acumen to blunt the sharp lack of personal emotional development; Mr. Burns and Bobo (IYKYK). But Harry is “immature”…? K. I was surprised by how many people fixated on his drug use. I didn’t realize there were so many Puritan prigs who were so deeply invested in condemning garden-variety adolescent behavior. Kick rocks, squares. Were you young in the ‘90s and 2000s? If you weren’t, you have no frame of reference. If you were, then you know his descriptions of alcohol and drugs were pretty tame, very average. I actually suspect the drug use was probably downplayed a bit; it’s natural to downplay that kind of youthful hedonism, and furthermore, elite boarding schools like the ones he attended are notorious for drugs and alcohol being ample and commonplace. To call him a druggie or an addict based on what he presents in this book is absurd. Another trend in the negative ratings/reviews are folks who’ve given it poor marks because of Harry’s description(s) of his time in the military. This is silly. I am and will forever be opposed to militarism and war, and I fully agree that the folks in charge of the UK and US in the 2000s are indeed a pack of war criminals, but giving this book 1 star because the author accurately describes the depravity and banality of modern warfare is bonkers. I wonder if these folks have read other soldiers’ memoirs, or other books written by folks who’ve participated in wars, missions, offensives, etc. His descriptions are no better or worse than passages from Anthony Swofford’s Gulf War memoir Jarhead, for example. And while that book certainly got its share of 1 and 2 star reviews, the seething hatred readers seems to have for Harry is notably absent from similarly rated reviews of Swofford’s book. Why the difference? Why hate so hard on Harry while having sympathy and understanding for Swofford? I think Prince Harry’s fame and privilege triggers or perhaps even enables a disturbing lack of empathy in a certain kind of individual; they cannot see him as a person, only as a royal, a prince, a symbol. Pretty ironic that they refuse to allow him space to be human – to be flawed, to be a follower, to fall short, to fuck up, to be “boring” – especially given that one of the harshest criticisms in these reviews re: military/Afghanistan was his own “dehumanizing” of the enemy. This is basic war stuff, folks. It is literally the modis operandi of every military, army, militia, guerilla group, etc. since the dawn of time: dehumanize the enemy. I find the clutching of pearls to the chest at his descriptions of things soldiers do in wartime to be disingenuous, contrived, and intellectually dishonest. Really? You didn’t know soldiers kill people with impunity and appear to lack remorse? This shocks you, that they compartmentalize it and tell themselves that it’s part of the job? I do not believe they would judge an average British soldier’s experience so harshly for the same perceived offenses or transgressions. Moreover, anyone who characterizes the re-telling of Harry’s time in Afghanistan as “bragging” about killing people needs to work on their reading comprehension because nothing of the sort occurs in these pages. The vitriol directed at this memoir is bland and trite, a simple re-packaging of the same old Baby Boomer naysaying nonsense that’s been hurled at Millennials since the oldest Millennials became adults, i.e. roughly the past two decades. More to the point, they are the same hackneyed tropes that the old have always volleyed at the young: they’re spoiled. They’re soft. They’re “entitled.” They complain too much. We had it worse. The only thing missing was “NoBoDy WaNtS tO WoRk AnYmOrE!” Yawn. OK, Boomer. All the critiques boil down to something along the lines of “This is a rich guy writing about rich people problems.” And while that statement is more or less accurate, it’s not a critique. It’s stating the obvious. I’m confused as to why folks who claim not to be interested in rich people’s problems would take the time to read 400 pages about a rich guy’s problems. Again, I ask: what were you all expecting? Three stars.

Rating 3 out of 5,"An emotive memoir divided into three parts: Harry’s early years, his time in the army, and finally, his relationship and marriage to Meghan and the subsequent fallout with his immediate family. It is well-written and constructed, and by and large, an engaging read penned by ghost-writer J.R. Moehringer. However, I struggled with the content.I don’t really understand the relevance of the title, but Harry clearly sees himself as a spare part and carries this heavy chip on his shoulder to this day. I simply see him as a sad, angry, lost soul, envious at times of his brother, constantly seeking his true identity, uncomfortable in his own skin unless its on the battlefield and at times, unaware of his tremendous wealth and privilege. For someone claiming to be blissfully happy since walking away from The Firm, this feels like a contradictory statement.The recurrent themes throughout are the life-long affects of the death of his mother and the circumstances in which she died. Who can forget the shocking circumstances of Diana’s death, and it is heartbreaking that Harry didn’t really accept she was dead until many years after the event. But for Harry, blame was always firmly laid at the door of the media, and thereafter, attention from the press is something which Harry has never been able to deal with rationally. I’d go so far as to say his hate has manifested itself in a major persecution complex. And yet… he’s now inviting that very medium to further his own image and garner support, a medium which has been the bane of his life and according to him, killed his mother. Coupled with what we already thought we knew, there are many contradictory passages and some not quite believable incidents. Add in a fair bit of family bickering detailed here and there, and none of this endears the reader; it only serves to make Harry looked immature. For a memoir which includes a large famous cast, it feels very accusatory, and viewed from a single, blinkered perspective. The celebrity lifestyle of his wife isn’t something which mixes easily with the British monarchy, but if we’re to believe this is what Harry now wants perhaps it will go some way to healing his problem with the press, although I think it more likely to provide a springboard to a single, self-destructive future.I used to like Harry a lot but now, I really don’t recognise him at all.Show more",3,An emotive memoir divided into three parts Harrys early years his time in the army and finally his relationship and marriage to Meghan and the subsequent fallout with his immediate family It is wellwritten and constructed and by and large an engaging read penned by ghostwriter JR Moehringer However I struggled with the contentI dont really understand the relevance of the title but Harry clearly sees himself as a spare part and carries this heavy chip on his shoulder to this day I simply see him as a sad angry lost soul envious at times of his brother constantly seeking his true identity uncomfortable in his own skin unless its on the battlefield and at times unaware of his tremendous wealth and privilege For someone claiming to be blissfully happy since walking away from The Firm this feels like a contradictory statementThe recurrent themes throughout are the lifelong affects of the death of his mother and the circumstances in which she died Who can forget the shocking circumstances of Dianas death and it is heartbreaking that Harry didnt really accept she was dead until many years after the event But for Harry blame was always firmly laid at the door of the media and thereafter attention from the press is something which Harry has never been able to deal with rationally Id go so far as to say his hate has manifested itself in a major persecution complex And yet hes now inviting that very medium to further his own image and garner support a medium which has been the bane of his life and according to him killed his mother Coupled with what we already thought we knew there are many contradictory passages and some not quite believable incidents Add in a fair bit of family bickering detailed here and there and none of this endears the reader it only serves to make Harry looked immature For a memoir which includes a large famous cast it feels very accusatory and viewed from a single blinkered perspective The celebrity lifestyle of his wife isnt something which mixes easily with the British monarchy but if were to believe this is what Harry now wants perhaps it will go some way to healing his problem with the press although I think it more likely to provide a springboard to a single selfdestructive futureI used to like Harry a lot but now I really dont recognise him at allShow more
Rating 4 out of 5,"3.5 ⭐️, rounding up. Overall, I enjoyed the book and thought it was mostly interesting and well-written (good ghostwriter). The audiobook version (read by Harry) was great, and I thought the introduction did a good job explaining why he wanted to share his story, which I can appreciate. But it also felt too long and some parts were boring, while other parts had details that seem like they could hardly have much overall relevance to his life story and just felt salacious (yep, I’m talking about the frostbitten penis). I felt for him, dealing with the loss of his mother which was clearly traumatic and impacted everything else in his life moving forward. Moving through parts 2 and 3 though, there were times when Harry seemed whiny and entitled, despite his reflection and introspection.

I think a lot of criticism/praise for this book firmly pits you into either camp Royals or camp Harry/Megan with no other nuances. I will say that I am more likely to have sympathy for Harry and Megan rather than Charles or William, but I don't think Harry necessarily paints himself as a saint.I understand that Harry has a clearly toxic relationship with the press. He has good reasons to not like them but uses them to maintain their lifestyle. I don't see a problem with him writing a memoir. If he wants to air the dirty laundry of everyone who has ""wronged"" him - go for it. Apparently, those bridges have already been long burned anyway.

Rating 4 out of 5,"**Disclaimer - This is a joint review with Kelli from our 2 Girls Bookin' It blog**Like a lot of people, we were both excited for Prince Harry's autobiography to be released. While there have been documentaries, interviews, etc. coming out about Prince Harry and Meghan's perspectives, nothing quite so explicit to Prince Harry had been released. Our book club was also interested in reading this, so it became our latest book club read. And oh boy is there a lot to discuss.First off, this is really a book about his life up until this point, not just since his relationship with Meghan began (which a lot of the press surrounding this release really honed in on). Now of course we're going to preface our whole review with the disclaimer that we know every story has more than one side. Much like Kelsea Ballerini's new EP states, ""The rumors going 'round, but the truth is kinda nuanced."" It was shocking, yet not at all, the relationship between William and Harry - ""the Heir and the Spare."" If both have been living in the same toxic environment for years, with similar yet vastly different expectations of them, of course there is going to be animosity and tension. The extent of it, however, was not something we were expecting. We've even gone back and watched some of the interviews Harry mentions in the book to see if we can pick up on any of the things he brings up, and if you pay close enough attention, you can pick up on little looks and smirks, especially coming from Prince William. It is also a little sad to us to see the tension and competitiveness between the brothers from Prince Harry's perspective. As two brothers, and young boys, who went through a horrific tragedy, and mainly only had each other to lean on, you would think that relationship would be the most important and loving for the two of them. They both lost their mother. They both had to grieve and be present in the public eye. Only they can know how the other may be feeling and coping. We can never imagine being in that type of situation, but we would imagine leaning on a sibling would be the most comforting. Speaking of Princess Diana, we find it heart wrenching that Prince Harry did not receive the grief counseling he so desperately needed. It was clear through the many pages of this book that Prince Harry did not receive the support he truly needed, and even did not fully believe his mother died. How far into his teens did he keep referring to his mother's disappearance rather than her death? We both found this incredibly sad and yet so telling. Instead of spending the necessary time to work through his feelings and even his thoughts of what occurred, he is instead thrust into the limelight of the world to watch his every movement as he grieved and went through the motions of the funeral arrangements. Then fairly quickly after this, Prince Harry is sent off to boarding school, in the mindset of, ""Okay, that is done, let's move on."" You could tell from Prince Harry's point of view he thought he would have his brother to spend time with, to lean on, and to even just be there for him, but no. Prince William told him explicitly that he did not know him while at school. Harsh, but coming from an older brother perspective, understandable. We also loved seeing Prince Harry's relationship with Africa. The friends and the experiences he found there may have been just what he needed to find peace in a life filled with so many negative experiences. And it seems that may have been when first had spiritual experiences that really altered the course of his life. Granted, he already had a connection with Africa because of his mother, but he really took her legacy and expanded on it so much that it has now become part of his legacy as well. It was nice to see that Harry found a passion in Africa, as well as friends who seemed to have become chosen family. While we loved Spare, we do realize there are inconsistencies. However, one of the big ones we've been hearing about is how he and Meghan continue to interact with the press despite leaving the Royal Family because they wanted a quieter life. Our opinion, based on the book, is that they mean the British press. They have harassed his family for years, generations even, with no repercussions. And, in fact, even had help from other members of the Royal Family, which was quite shocking. We were most surprised, or maybe we shouldn't be, of how Camilla used the press and Prince Harry's antics to her benefit to look better in the public eye. And on top of this, Prince Harry mentions there were times both Camilla and Prince Charles used the British press to their benefit and to Prince Harry's detriment. Reading that is quite shocking - this is your son, and you are going to paint them in a negative light to the world to benefit yourself? Once Meghan came into the picture, the hate campaign emerged, and Prince Harry and Meghan were pitted against Prince William and Catherine. How and why? As Meghan mentioned in the Oprah interview, why does it have to be one or the other? You can like one of them and not have to hate the other. Who truly began this comparison, with Catherine always shining and Meghan always in the negative?Additionally, Harry did seem to go pretty easy on his ""granny."" Which we understand based on the references to them each treating each other special compared to other relatives. After all, once he lost his mother, Queen Elizabeth was the mother figure for him. Reading through the pages and lines, we think Granny was his source of comfort in some ways, and he brought fun and laughter to her. However, there is no way the Queen was so ignorant of the things going on around her. Was she aware family members called Prince Harry ""Spare"" to his face, or is that how things are done in the Royal Family (the Queen's own sister was called that as well)? Did the Queen approve of family members using the press against each other, or did her own team do so as well for her own benefit? When Prince Harry and Meghan reached their true limit of pain and negativity, did she truly listen and try to help them, or make it as difficult as it ended up being? We will never truly know, and as we already said, there are two sides to every story. It was empowering to see Prince Harry found a purpose for himself with the military. To see him find strength, courage, belief in himself and what he was capable of was inspiring. He went through rigorous training and wanted to be there alongside his comrades, the men and women he spent weeks and months with learning each other's strengths and weaknesses. Seeing himself as a danger, not only for himself but for his fellow comrades, was sad. We were glad to see he was able to find a compromise and a way to spend some time overseas to fight for what he believed in. Though we don't know if he should have shared quite as much as he did about his experience, we appreciate his candidness and openness. And taking those moments, experiences, and connections, and putting that to one of the best uses he could by creating the Invictus Games was beautiful. We think it is that one thing in his life he can truly feel he made the biggest difference ever for the men and women who have put everything into their military careers and sustained life changing injuries and illnesses. There is no doubt Prince Harry has experienced insane amounts of physical and emotion hardship throughout his life. With each negative experience or situation, he finds a way through, resilient as ever. He comes across as a dedicated and talented soldier who loved what he did. He comes across as an ordinary guy just trying to live his life, find love and happiness in the simplest of things (binge watching Friends made us both laugh as we love that show!). He also comes across as a very privileged young man who has had access to education, people, and places that many others could not dream of. With all this in mind, we truly feel for Prince Harry. At the end of the day, we feel he is still just the lost, little boy searching for his mother and direction. That one moment in time truly changed the rest of his life, and who can say if it was for the better or worse. We will not dive too deeply into the relationship between Prince Harry and Meghan. There is a lot of negative press about the two of them, and there is also a lot of media news catching the two of them in lies or changing things they have said. All we will say is that Prince Harry printed a beautiful tale of the two of them falling in love. We are happy they had longer together as a couple before they were outed to the world than we thought. It sounds like a whirlwind romance and the fact they both chose each other, even knowing how difficult it could be, is beautiful. We wish them all the best and hope that the choices they have made bring them happiness in their lives.Overall, we saw a lot of comments of how this book was not good, and was just a hate filled tale of Prince Harry's unhappiness and spilling his family's secrets. We did not see this. We thoroughly enjoyed this story in the fact we were able to learn more about Prince Harry from the direct source himself. Reading his side of many moments in history we saw in the news was enlightening. And truthfully, we were both saddened by how lost Prince Harry came across through most of his tale. We truly wish Prince Harry can find happiness in his new life and some semblance of peace when it comes to his family, the Royal Family. Show more",4,Disclaimer  This is a joint review with Kelli from our 2 Girls Bookin It blogLike a lot of people we were both excited for Prince Harrys autobiography to be released While there have been documentaries interviews etc coming out about Prince Harry and Meghans perspectives nothing quite so explicit to Prince Harry had been released Our book club was also interested in reading this so it became our latest book club read And oh boy is there a lot to discussFirst off this is really a book about his life up until this point not just since his relationship with Meghan began which a lot of the press surrounding this release really honed in on Now of course were going to preface our whole review with the disclaimer that we know every story has more than one side Much like Kelsea Ballerinis new EP states The rumors going round but the truth is kinda nuanced It was shocking yet not at all the relationship between William and Harry  the Heir and the Spare If both have been living in the same toxic environment for years with similar yet vastly different expectations of them of course there is going to be animosity and tension The extent of it however was not something we were expecting Weve even gone back and watched some of the interviews Harry mentions in the book to see if we can pick up on any of the things he brings up and if you pay close enough attention you can pick up on little looks and smirks especially coming from Prince William It is also a little sad to us to see the tension and competitiveness between the brothers from Prince Harrys perspective As two brothers and young boys who went through a horrific tragedy and mainly only had each other to lean on you would think that relationship would be the most important and loving for the two of them They both lost their mother They both had to grieve and be present in the public eye Only they can know how the other may be feeling and coping We can never imagine being in that type of situation but we would imagine leaning on a sibling would be the most comforting Speaking of Princess Diana we find it heart wrenching that Prince Harry did not receive the grief counseling he so desperately needed It was clear through the many pages of this book that Prince Harry did not receive the support he truly needed and even did not fully believe his mother died How far into his teens did he keep referring to his mothers disappearance rather than her death We both found this incredibly sad and yet so telling Instead of spending the necessary time to work through his feelings and even his thoughts of what occurred he is instead thrust into the limelight of the world to watch his every movement as he grieved and went through the motions of the funeral arrangements Then fairly quickly after this Prince Harry is sent off to boarding school in the mindset of Okay that is done lets move on You could tell from Prince Harrys point of view he thought he would have his brother to spend time with to lean on and to even just be there for him but no Prince William told him explicitly that he did not know him while at school Harsh but coming from an older brother perspective understandable We also loved seeing Prince Harrys relationship with Africa The friends and the experiences he found there may have been just what he needed to find peace in a life filled with so many negative experiences And it seems that may have been when first had spiritual experiences that really altered the course of his life Granted he already had a connection with Africa because of his

Rating 5 out of 5,"I loved Prince Harry, The Duke of Sussex's memoir, SPARE!  A big fan of Meghan's SUITS and team Harry/Meghan all the way.I listened to the audiobook narrated by the author for a captivating performance. I highly recommend the audiobook, whether you are a Royal fan or want to know more about Harry's heartfelt journey. Prince Harry shares honest stories from his childhood, the powerful love of his mother, his grief, life, and the stresses of being a Royal. We hear stories from his military career, his charity work, his PTSD, and his work with veterans and causes. His mother's traumatic death significantly impacted him in ways we will never fully understand.I thoroughly enjoyed hearing about his meeting Meghan for the first time, their relationship, dating, marriage, and children. Also, their many struggles being part of the Royal family and the decision to leave for their safety and mental health.From abuse, racism, and the lies and betrayal they encountered—His mother was the last to try to escape and commend Harry and Meghan for wanting more for their life and not winding up the same. I congratulate them for having the courage to leave, which could not have been an easy decision with all they had to give up for a better life. The press is brutal, and we have no idea what he, Meghan, and Princess Diana went through. Also, the jealousy of his brother and wife when Harry and Meghan are not afraid to be out there working and doing good in the world. It is sad hearing about all the stress they had to face when trying to get away from financial loss, a home, and lack of family support, and just trying to escape the press. I loved hearing about Tyler Perry offering his home in California as a haven for a short while.I enjoyed the part in the book toward the end when Meghan tells Harry is much more than a Spare. Priceless. I also laughed about him shopping at TJ Maxx. I am so proud of them and fully support them leaving the royal family for their sanity, mental health, wellness, and safety for their beautiful family. I love Santa Barbara and am happy they have found a home in America. We welcome them to the states and hope they will be safe and much happiness away from prying eyes, pressure, gossip, jealousy, and the horrible press. I wish them all the best. Delighted, he finally had the opportunity to tell his story, and the book is one to treasure. The vast amounts he has raised for good and given to charities, and even portions of the book proceeds are donated. Well done! If you are a fan of Harry or Meghan, you do not want to miss this one!

Rating 4 out of 5,"Think what you will about Prince Harry but I like him, and I believe him. There was much to learn about the dynamics of the royal family here that I never would’ve guessed. It’s also well-written, with quotations from and allusions to Hamlet interspersed throughout. I was duly impressed, but then I read that he used a ghostwriter. The same one who ghostwrote Andre Agassi’s “Open,” apparently, hence the similar-looking book covers and one-word titles. Still, I enjoyed the book and listening to him narrate it, although parts of it were too long for my liking, such as the part about his military battles in Afghanistan.Show more",4,Think what you will about Prince Harry but I like him and I believe him There was much to learn about the dynamics of the royal family here that I never wouldve guessed Its also wellwritten with quotations from and allusions to Hamlet interspersed throughout I was duly impressed but then I read that he used a ghostwriter The same one who ghostwrote Andre Agassis Open apparently hence the similarlooking book covers and oneword titles Still I enjoyed the book and listening to him narrate it although parts of it were too long for my liking such as the part about his military battles in AfghanistanShow more
Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5/5 (Based on the length of this review, clearly there is a lot of talk about so this would make a great book club book FYI)Whatever your opinion on the Royal family or Prince Harry might be, one thing for sure is that no one knows what it’s like to have lived his life - not even other royals because he and William share the unique experiences of being the first to grow up in a time of the Internet. There is no denying his privilege and wealth (there’s reminders of it on every single page) and this book will not “justify” or “redeem” the concept of the British monarchy - they are colonizers who live off of inherited stolen wealth. The reason to read this book is because of morbid curiosity.Harry splits his life into three parts:1. His life after his mother’s death, his school year, growing up a young Prince, his first relationships, time in Africa2. His time in the military, his mid 20s, trying to navigate his more adult role in his family, more romantic relationships 3. Meeting and falling in love with Meghan, their life as a married couple, and the events that led them to leave the Royal familyAnd throughout it all is the looming presence of the paparazzi, a tame name for them honestly considering they’re straight up stalkers and harassers.My favorite part of this book was when Harry talks about Diana. In those paragraphs, he is not writing as a public figure, a Prince, or a man trying to “make a quick buck”, but as a son who misses his mother very much. I have so much respect for him for how vulnerably he writes about his mother’s death - I mean, imagine the worst day of your life, the worst pain and loss that was made worse by the media, the same people who caused your mother’s death, and then letting millions of people read about it. His profound grief and love for his mother permeates through every word and every page. It’s very genuine and heartbreaking and I think his vulnerability makes this the strongest aspect of his memoir - I’d be very surprised to hear criticism of this. One of the most chilling moments was when he describes looking through the police file of Diana’s death and sees halos around her face and realizes that those are flashes from cameras. And that realization that the last thing she ever saw was the paparazzi - my heart broke. I also think the way he writes about his mother and the constant harassment of the paparazzi explains a lot of why he makes the decisions he does later on.This book reminds me greatly of a famous Bollywood movie, Kabhi Kushi Kabhi Gham (Sometimes happy, sometimes sad), a story about a tight knit, seemingly perfect family, torn apart by the patriach’s refusal to accept his eldest son’s wife. It’s a story about a type of grief that only family can cause, the bond between siblings, strength of love, and pitfalls of pride - in a way very reflective of the current Royal family’s riff. It’s really sad seeing how much they’ve all distanced from each other. Not that Harry or William were ever super close, but whatever bonds and relationships existed within the family could not withstand the pressure of the crown, the media, and their emphasis on the survival of the monarchy. From Harry’s perspective, it does seem that jealously and competition got in the way of any fraternal bonds. And I do admire that Harry doesn’t outright call people evil as some people expect him to - let’s not forget that this is still his family.One part that stuck out to me was when William and Charles get mad at Harry for issuing a statement on Meghan’s behalf because they hadn’t done that for their wives. I’m firmly on Harry’s side for that because why did they ever just accept that behavior? Because they need good public perception it’s okay to harass and degrade these women? And it is different for Meghan because they did bring in her race. At least he stopped that cycle, someone had to do it first.Also this part?“I remembered the time he and Camilla wanted Kate to change the spelling of her name, because there were already two royal cyphers with a C and a crown above: Charles and Camilla. It would be too confusing to have another. Make it Katherine with a K, they suggested.” My god.I do empathize with Harry as he very candidly talks about his experiences with the paparazzi. It was exhausting to read about them on every other page, I can only imagine how exhausting it must have been to live it. Harry talks about his many failed relationships, the majority of them ending because the girl didn’t want this life and Harry didn’t want to ask her to live it. I was very sad when I read that one of the girls, Caroline Flack, later ended her life because of the nagging from the media years later. I mean, it’s constant harassment - this presence that he has to endure because of who he is and who he was born to, and not just endure, but somewhat foster it because so much of the monarchy’s survival depends on public support. Which brings another interesting conversation about the unnatural symbiotic relationship between the tabloids and the Royal family, in the digital age at that.The majority of part 2 made me want to stop reading because all it was is chapter filled with details about Harry’s time in the military. Obviously this is a very influential time in his life, but there were so many technical details about every single deployment that were not necessary. I get him trying to make the point that he worked hard, he didn’t get special treatment, is a patriot, and that it wasn’t for show, but unless you actually care about the military, it’s very boring to read about.There are also definitely moments of cringe attempts at humor (did we really need to hear about his frosted penis for so many pages just to try to connect it to the message that time heals? No.), dramatic statements (the prologue with the nod to BrainyQuote.com), trying to gain sympathy while describing the most privileged experiences, trying to be relatable (when he watched Friends in 2 weeks), and lots of braggy moments with the attitude of “yeah I’m a great person, it’s just who I am” (when he ran after an elephant barefoot and everyone is like wow, when he was learning how to fly a helicopter and expected applause, he’s complaining about flying the hard helicopter but his superiors tell him he’s too good to give up, him saving someone’s life by pulling out their tongue after they fell off a horse, when he helped his friend after he had been mugged) - events that serve no purpose except to show he’s a good person. I did have the purple highlighter reserved for “lol wtf” moments. But despite this, his love and gratitude for Africa is very apparent and his dedication to the Invictus Games is real - so in between pitfalls, he does have moments that humanize him more. I do believe he is genuine throughout.Him speaking about Diana and his love for Meghan are the two parts of this memoir that no one can claim is false. His love for her is obvious, seen both through his words and actions. All these people saying she manipulated him are so so far from the truth. It’s so sad to read about all the harassment she endured, the depth of her depression, the familial relationships that were broken - both of them have made many huge sacrifices to be together and that is not for show.“ Hey…I know you. But also: I need to know you. Hey, I’ve known you forever. But also: I’ve been searching for you forever. Hey, thank God you’ve arrived. But also: What took you so long?”This book is what it is - it tells Harry’s life from him himself and explains his side of why he left the Royal family. I never didn’t not sympathize with them so my opinion of Harry didn’t really change - I still have empathy for what he’s been through, what Meghan has been through. I admire that he did write respectfully of everyone and with surprisingly good prose. Like I mentioned at the beginning, if you’re curious, then read it. But it’s in no way a must read.Show more",3,355 Based on the length of this review clearly there is a lot of talk about so this would make a great book club book FYIWhatever your opinion on the Royal

Rating 4 out of 5,"I have so much to say about this book, but I'll stick to just a couple of points of interest. Prince Harry's autobiography was surprisingly riveting - surprising because I have minimal interest in the royal family, as an institution. But it's because I find the institution deeply problematic that I picked up this book to begin with. I'm more interested in the personal, the flawed, the greys, than in any PR image or clickbait. And as far as I know, this is the first time one of the immediate royal family has 'broken ranks' to write one. I've never been interested in the pomp and pageantry. These are human beings who are never allowed to be seen or heard as such. The reasons are both simple and complex. The British tabloids are the scum of the earth, so why do so many people not only read them but believe them? Why are so many people entertained by others' misfortune, or enjoy creating feuds for others to live through? Clearly this is old, you can see it in the stories of gods (Greek, Roman, Egyptian, all of them). That doesn't make it 'good', especially when the focus is real, living, feeling people. The toxic relationship of press-and-people interests me, and it's one of several questions and issues tackled in the telling of Harry's story, which starts when his mother is killed by paparazzi (not tried or convicted of course - the sickening relationship the royals have with the press is a source of rage for Harry).Grief is another - he says ""grief is a thing best shared"" and yet they're expected to maintain silence, show zero emotion and avoid the weakness of physical touch. Is it any wonder these people are f*cked up and resist Harry's desire for freedom from the press?His time in the army taught him both the necessity of Othering the enemy in a time of war, and the dangers of doing so. Murdoch especially is a focus of Harry's condemnation, and rightly so. He says he can't think of a single other person in the history of humankind who has ""done more damage to our collective sense of reality"" than Murdoch and his 'news' empire.Throughout the journey from childhood to adulthood and falling in love with Meghan, he acknowledges his stupid mistakes (like referring to a mate as ""Paki"") and his privilege. Everything is approved by others, his father paid for everything not because he's a spoilt rich boy but because he was ""my boss, my banker, my comptroller"" and cutting Harry off financially ""meant firing me"". Basically, we can't judge him too much by our own standards, because his life is completely different. But he is still human.Spare is frank and honest, revealing and raw. Piling on Harry (and Meghan) is easy to do, and doesn't make anyone feel better for it; listening to what he has to say is a humanising act.Show more",4,I have so much to say about this book but Ill stick to just a couple of points of interest Prince Harrys autobiography was surprisingly riveting  surprising because I have minimal interest in the royal family as an institution But its because I find the institution deeply problematic that I picked up this book to begin with Im more interested in the personal the flawed the greys than in any PR image or clickbait And as far as I know this is the first time one of the immediate royal family has broken ranks to write one Ive never been interested in the pomp and pageantry These are human beings who are never allowed to be seen or heard as such The reasons are both simple and complex The British tabloids are the scum of the earth so why do so many people not only read them but believe them Why are so many people entertained by others misfortune or enjoy creating feuds for others to live through Clearly this is old you can see it in the stories of gods Greek Roman Egyptian all of them That doesnt make it good especially when the focus is real living feeling people The toxic relationship of pressandpeople interests me and its one of several questions and issues tackled in the telling of Harrys story which starts when his mother is killed by paparazzi not tried or convicted of course  the sickening relationship the royals have with the press is a source of rage for HarryGrief is another  he says grief is a thing best shared and yet theyre expected to maintain silence show zero emotion and avoid the weakness of physical touch Is it any wonder these people are fcked up and resist Harrys desire for freedom from the pressHis time in the army taught him both the necessity of Othering the enemy in a time of war and the dangers of doing so Murdoch especially is a focus of Harrys condemnation and rightly so He says he cant think of a single other person in the history of humankind who has done more damage to our collective sense of reality than Murdoch and his news empireThroughout the journey from childhood to adulthood and falling in love with Meghan he acknowledges his stupid mistakes like referring to a mate as Paki and his privilege Everything is approved by others his father paid for everything not because hes a spoilt rich boy but because he was my boss my banker my comptroller and cutting Harry off financially meant firing me Basically we cant judge him too much by our own standards because his life is completely different But he is still humanSpare is frank and honest revealing and raw Piling on Harry and Meghan is easy to do and doesnt make anyone feel better for it listening to what he has to say is a humanising actShow more
Rating 4 out of 5,"I wouldn’t say that the book was riveting but it was somewhat revealing. The way Harry candidly talks about his mother while calling her death a disappearance, or how the paparazzi was always ambushing them, left me feeling sad for the guy. That’s why i appreciated Harry’s quick wit and concern for things other than himself. Something I find refreshing when it comes to the Royal family. Big shoutout to the Ghostwriter JR Moehringer. He does it again. A Pulitzer finalist and also ghostwriter of Shoe dog. Finally, do the book on audio.

Rating 5 out of 5,"If you’d told me Jan 1 that this would be the first book I finished in 2023, I would have been surprised. But when I started listening on Jan 10, I immediately set aside everything else I was listening to and reading, found stuff to clean; routes to run, etc. Spare is read on audiobook by the author, Prince Harry, the Duke or Sussex and I HIGHLY recommend this version. Listening to him tell his own story is an incredible experience. Going into reading this book, I was already a fan of the Sussexes. I’ve paid attention to the royals since Will and Kate got together, but especially after Meghan came into tie picture. However, the story told about the royals, and what is actually true from Harry’s perspective, diverge wildly. Even if you’re not invested in the royals, it’s still a fascinating, very well done memoir covering a lot of topics. This feels like Harry writing his own history book. He’s divulged far more about his own life than any person would probably feel comfortable. But it feels very much like him setting the record straight on a lot of things. However, that makes it sound like drudgery, and it’s not at all. It’s beautifully written (I know his ghostwriter is really good), his voice and personality and sense of humor continually shine through. I was moved to tears many times, surprisingly. The way he lost his mom at such a young age and struggled for decades to grieve is heartbreaking. More so, the breakdown of familial relationships is something many can empathize with. I loved the behind the scenes, adored the way Meghan and Harry have built a life together, and I finished the book wishing it was longer (it’s 15 hours). I could go on and on (if you’ve read it—message me and I’d love to discuss!) and I highly recommend it. 5/5.

Rating 5 out of 5,"Well, I didn't expect to give this 5 stars but in fairness, I have to. It was excellent. I know he didn't write it by himself, credit where due...ghostwriting is a real art and skill and this one absolutely understood the assignment and nailed it. I'm a devout anti-monarchist who is also a reluctant Royal Watcher from childhood and my early exposure to Good Housekeeping. My feelings about the Royal Family are not mixed, though. I want them turned out of their palaces and turned into regular citizens with an interesting family history. That out of the way...I'm hardly alone in finding Harry and Meghan a compelling story if book sales are any indication. I may be alone among my general group of friends in being compelled by it, however. And certainly in reading this book. Most won't condescend to it. Because they're egalitarian but not when it comes to books. So I'm going to be the lone voice from that patch of wilderness saying that I found the book courageous. Harry is so clearly a deeply wounded person who was left to tend to his own emotional needs and the way he gets around to doing it is a truly touching journey. The vulnerability that he has carried with him for so long - that we've all watched and been charmed by - is laid bare on every page. It can be a tough read at times. This is a book about a child's grief, at once impossibly public and completely ignored. Meghan is in here, but she's not central to the book in any way. If there's a woman who drives this narrative, it's Diana. The book is funny too. And alarming. And unflinching in its portrayal of other royals. Unflattering to almost all of them. But not mean spirited. My favorite moment of the book is the end...spoiler alert...which see Harry having put his baby and wife to bed...making his way to his Southern California backyard to roll a fatty. I don't know why. It just made me laugh. I have to address a point. A lot has been made about the discrepancy between Meg's and Harry's versions of Meg's first curtsy to QE2. Meg said that her curtsy was absurd and over the top. Harry says it was perfect. People, mostly English, are suggesting that one of them is lying. I don't think so. I think people do remember things differently. And I don't think English people truly appreciate how ABSURD Americans find the idea of curtsying. I would think that even a perfect curtsy being performed for REAL would feel INSANE to an American. Like a rom-com. English People, please hear me on this, Americans find this act to be hilariously silly.

Rating 2 out of 5,"2 stars for genuinely keeping me interested. Aside from that, this is written from the perspective of someone who genuinely believes every experience he has ever had is unique - he is the only person in the world to have issues with a family that demands certain levels of standards and respect, the only person in the world to have disagreements with their sibling, the only person to have lost a parent, the only person to be affected by the media. Tone deaf, contradictory, and entirely unreliable, this memoir is written by a weak, self pitying and narcissistic man who gave up everything but, as a recurring theme throughout the book, refuses to take any accountability for it. Essentially being a hate piece toward the British press for the life of me I can’t understand why, after begging and wishing every page for privacy, he would expose such details of his life like this, aside from a desperate reach for a payout now that he’s cut off, and to try to repair the ego he damaged himself.

Rating 3 out of 5,"view this review on my website !i think i should start with the obvious in that, this book is a profound and overarching recollection of grief of a young boy who lost his mother. i think it would be a disservice to not acknowledge how profoundly her death has impacted and informed so much of who Prince Harry is, at his very core.the majority of the book feels like a therapist's journaling exercise in which he is asked to confront his feelings while the undertone of the rest of the book seems to cover all the juicy topics highlighted in the press throughout his life. listening to his story, i was extremely conflicted. on the one hand, i sympathize with the child in him who needed compassion and understanding; but there are moments throughout the book that make me question his lack of self awareness and the position he has in this world. it makes sense he is unaware of the impact of racism when living within a structure and family which created it. does that make him intentionally ignorant? at what point does he become aware of it? are we to assume he has always been shielded from it or is it only important now that it affects people he loves? it's hard to say because how else will the impact be great if when he is greatly impacted. at the same time, is he to be held to a higher standard of awareness because of his position in society? are these purposes mutually exclusive?when friends asked what i thought of the book, i commented that i thought it would be a good study of the affects of the monarchy for those within it. there are several moments where i wonder if the relationship between him and his brother are more volatile than he is willing to admit; both aloud and to himself. in the end, while it was a good listen, it really didn't expand too much outside of what has already been previously shared in interviews and in the documentary they did on netflix.

Rating 2 out of 5,"Solid 2.5. Few people need a 400+ page memoir and I don’t think Harry was one of them. I am fully under the impression that this man used voice to text to put his stream of consciousness in the Notes app on his phone, then he sent it off to a publisher. A ghost writer then did little to no edits and here we are. I enjoyed reading about Diana and Megan, and hearing some of the thoughts Harry had on his grandmother, The Queen, and the institution as a whole. However, this was a lot less groundbreaking or surprising than I expected it to be. Most of the middle drags and to be frank, I just couldn’t care about his drawn out school or military stories. Some of this book rehashed what we saw in the Netflix doc too, so it felt like another money making gimmick. I don’t care that I paid for this book though because I’m fine funding the education and safety of Harry, Meg, and their kids. His racist father certainly won’t. Hard to round up to a 3, but not sure I feel the 2 stars fully captures my feelings. A very solid 2.5, that I was still very ok with reading.

Rating 4 out of 5,"Let’s get this out of the way: monarchy is stupid and the BRF should be unceremoniously be heaped into the annals of history. (Harry doesn’t necessarily agree, but then again, expecting him to is probably too much for anyone to hope for. He does agree that colonialism is shit, though, so there’s that.)I’ve seen all sorts of criticisms of what is shared in this memoir, of what hasn’t been shared, of him, of Harry & Meghan’s PR strategy, of various members of the royal family, and everything else under the sun. The thing is, none of that is the point. This is, for better or worse, a man who was raised in a gilded cage with no real affection or warmth after his mother was publicly and tragically killed when he was still a child. And the very same forces responsible for her death and his subsequent trauma went on to target his girlfriend/fiancé/wife/mother of his children. Can you blame him for being aghast and scared? The villains here are the media, according to him, and no sane person could disagree. What he appears to still be confused and especially hurt by is the web of profit and toxicity created by the family he was born into, now ensnaring his created family. I can’t imagine the hurt he must be feeling as he is being gaslit by his father and his only brother throughout all of this.Poor little rich boy, sure, if being snide about human pain is your bag I guess. For my part, I see this as a man who was thrust into this life from birth and didn’t have a choice in any of it.

Rating 3 out of 5,"This was surprisingly good. I'm not generally a fan of memoirs and the media leaks kind of made me want to read it less. But whatever ghostwriter helped him write this was definitely worth their fee.The beginning, dealing with the loss of his mother, is genuinely heartbreaking and touching. Even though it feels like everything that can be said about that woman has already been said, this felt fresh and raw.However, the second part of the book about Harry's time in the military were quite tedious to read and at one point all the helicopter flying lessons blend together.Part 3 makes up for this. Suspensefully written, the last fifty pages read like a claustrophobic thriller.

""My Mummy died so that justifies me being an ungrateful and awful human being to my own family"" 
--Prince Harry It sucks to lose anyone but life makes us all a victim of something, it doesn't excuse our own behavior, dear Harry.On the one hand, I cannot conceive how a grown man with even a shred of dignity would allow himself to be publicly humiliated in front of the entire world like this. On the other hand.... I get why this book was written. I mean, this book is a perfect example of what is wrong with this new generation. Selfish, self centered, no sense of loyalty or responsibility and constant need to be a victim. Imagine what this book could have been - a riveting, graceful and poignant narrative about grief and loss. A positive note that would inspire a lot of people who have experienced loss or family dispute or how hard it is growing apart. Instead we have a salacious novel about a guy bitching about family problems and being a 'spare' that once again proves how spoiled and entitled these people are. I mean, when you grow up as one of the most privileged people on the planet it is hard to feel sorry for you when you are whining about normal family drama. Grow the fuck up, man!!!!

Rating 1 out of 5,"I love gossip. Most importantly, I love petty gossip.

Rating 2 out of 5,"I picked this book with an open mind, when i say open mind i mean i don't follow the ""drama"" but i do know the controversial situation going on with The Royals and Harry. However, i am unsure and honestly don't want to discuss who is wrong and who is right. After reading the last page and thinking about the book all i feel is sympathy for the whole family. My heart goes out for the two sons who lost their wonderful mother . The book quite clearly talks about the harsh unmovable Royal protocols, siblings rivalry , Harry's trauma and fear of losing his family like his mother, darkest sides of British tabloids and mostly seen known parts of Harry's life. Even if you have not been following the drama quite well you will not find anything new in the book. The first part felt like an immature supressed teenager ranting about how he acquires less privileges than his elder brother.The second part of the book was a full boredom for me which contains all details of his military journey. The third part is the one with all the gossips and behind the scenes from his first meet with Megan till the day of the death of HRH QUEEN ELIZABETH II .  In conclusion trying my best not to give a diplomatic answer I only find both the parted families doing what is best for their family. The only culprits are the press, duties , ranks , power and money.Show more",2,I picked this book with an open mind when i say open mind i mean i dont follow the drama but i do know the controversial situation going on with The Royals and Harry However i am unsure and honestly dont want to discuss who is wrong and who is right After reading the last page and thinking about the book all i feel is sympathy for the whole family My heart goes out for the two sons who lost their wonderful mother  The book quite clearly talks about the harsh unmovable Royal protocols siblings rivalry  Harrys trauma and fear of losing his family like his mother darkest sides of British tabloids and mostly seen known parts of Harrys life Even if you have not been following the drama quite well you will not find anything new in the book The first part felt like an immature supressed teenager ranting about how he acquires less privileges than his elder brotherThe second part of the book was a full boredom for me which contains all details of his military journey The third part is the one with all the gossips and behind the scenes from his first meet with Megan till the day of the death of HRH QUEEN ELIZABETH II   In conclusion trying my best not to give a diplomatic answer I only find both the parted families doing what is best for their family The only culprits are the press duties  ranks  power and moneyShow more
Rating 1 out of 5,I’m not sure what prompted him to write this book (if it was even him) if his end goal is to reconcile with the Royal Family.

Rating 2 out of 5,"I am very torn on how to review this book. Indeed, discussion about his trauma and the obviously, if potentially slightly inaccurate (after all we only get one side), unfair treatment the monarch gave him from the beginning of his life up to his marriage was, at least to me, easy to empathize with. Yet, at the heart of this book, I find it all so selfish. He has no problem with the institution of the monarchy itself and only attacks it for hurting him and his wife, and rightly so, but perhaps such attacks would have caused him to take a step back and consider the (neo)imperialism that the monarch has and continues to benefit from and maintain. Moreover, consider the status quo the monarch maintains and how it hurts everyone...he mentions his father getting flak from the press for urging action on climate change but again this lacks a connection to who will be most impacted by climate change and the monarch's role in this. Yes, it's an autobiography but that doesn't mean it needs to only be focused on the narrowest of ideas. This lack of connection is especially obvious when he spends so much time discussing Africa, a place hard hit by British imperialism and neo-colonialism. Early in the book he labels it as feeling ""free"" to him but yet goes on to describe the suffering of the many African countries he visits. The book could have been so...impactful...if it took a stand for something more than just himself and his family and I wish Harry had done that. Nonetheless, I appreciated many parts of the book and Harry's openness.Show more",2,I am very torn on how to review this book Indeed discussion about his trauma and the obviously if potentially slightly inaccurate after all we only get one side unfair treatment the monarch gave him from the beginning of his life up to his marriage was at least to me easy to empathize with Yet at the heart of this book I find it all so selfish He has no problem with the institution of the monarchy itself and only attacks it for hurting him and his wife and rightly so but perhaps such attacks would have caused him to take a step back and consider the neoimperialism that the monarch has and continues to benefit from and maintain Moreover consider the status quo the monarch maintains and how it hurts everyonehe mentions his father getting flak from the press for urging action on climate change but again this lacks a connection to who will be most impacted by climate change and the monarchs role in this Yes its an autobiography but that doesnt mean it needs to only be focused on the narrowest of ideas This lack of connection is especially obvious when he spends so much time discussing Africa a place hard hit by British imperialism and neocolonialism Early in the book he labels it as feeling free to him but yet goes on to describe the suffering of the many African countries he visits The book could have been soimpactfulif it took a stand for something more than just himself and his family and I wish Harry had done that Nonetheless I appreciated many parts of the book and Harrys opennessShow more

Rating 5 out of 5,"“That was the night all doubt fell away. ‘She’s dead,’ I thought. ‘My God. She’s really gone for good.’” 😭😭⭐️ Five stars for Prince Harry’s memoir Spare. ⭐️When I heard Prince Harry was coming out with a memoir, I initially wasn’t interested. Not sure what changed between the announcement and release date. Perhaps I got caught up in the hype? 1,400 holds on the physical copy at the library certainly got my attention. Anyway, I listened to the audio version on Audible and devoured this book in a week. (He reads it so that helps a ton.)What I expected from this memoir: A brief history of his life, revealing how he felt losing his mom, a few spicy details about the royal family, a strong defense of Megxit, a takedown of the British press, clearing up some widespread rumors. It’s all there. Check, check, check, check, check, check.But it’s so much more.First of all, the tea – as they say – is PIPING HOT ☕️. There are some shocking details in this book. We need The Crown to keep going so they can dramatize some of these scenes. Sheesh! Ultimately, I finished the book liking William a lot less and Kate a little more. (I like Kate, but I know a “mean girl” when I see one 😏). Camilla is the true villain though and Charles is a mess. Overall, I can’t believe there is still a literal monarchy in 2023 🙄But I digress…Spare wasn’t ALL drama. He talked A LOT about losing his mom and thinking she wasn’t dead. For years he thought she willingly disappeared and was going to come back for them 🥹. The quote I opened this review with is what he said when he finally realized – ten years – later that Princess Diana really passed away. Losing her is a thread that is woven throughout the book 💔He also talked at length about his life in the military. It clearly meant the world to him. Wasn’t super interesting to me, but other readers might like that part 😬I was most surprised about his enduring desire to get married. He talked about being in his late twenties and early thirties and longing for a wife and family of his own. That surprised me because, for a while, Harry was the most eligible bachelor in the world. Remember that weird reality show “I Wanna Marry Harry” and it was a Prince Harry lookalike, but the women contestants supposedly thought it was really him? Truly bizarre television. Harry describes pretty transparently how lonely he felt and how much he wanted to have his own family. And then he met Meghan Markle. Part three should have just been called “Harry loves Meghan and that is the beginning, middle, end, and everything you ever need to know”. Have you heard the quote, “the face that launched a thousand ships”? That is how Harry feels about Meghan. It’s so sweet and kind of funny to me how flabbergasted he is that everyone is not as enamored with her as he is. He’s basically yelling from the rooftops: “this is the smartest, most beautiful, most selfless, most talented, most perfect soul to walk the planet.” And the rest of the Royal Family just shrugs like “she emails her staff early in the morning & that’s rude” and “don’t bring her when you say your final goodbyes to your grandma” 😵‍💫 It’s not clear why they didn’t like her. Perhaps they thought the relationship moved too fast? William and Kate dated for ten years and King Charles dragged his relationship with Camilla through decades and an entirely separate marriage for both of them. So perhaps they thought Harry and Meghan should have waited a few years? I’m not sure. But it’s clear the Royal Family wasn’t invested in Harry and Meghan’s success as a couple or as individuals. In fact, reading this memoir does give you the impression that had the Royal Family actually defended Meghan to the press for once instead of standing by while she received an unprecedented onslaught of criticism and attacks, they would have never left.What an awful situation for Meghan to marry into!I don’t like how the British press painted Meghan as this divisive person who broke up Harry and William’s happy brotherhood. Clearly, the princes were never besties. In fact, Harry comes off somewhat delusional when he talks about wanting to get married and be “the Fab Four” with him, his wife, William and Kate. Prince William clearly had no interest in a close relationship with Prince Harry and getting married wasn’t going to change that.I also cannot comprehend what it’s like to grow up in the very definition of “the lap of luxury” and then be tossed out into the world with no work history, ability to make money, or security (that you’ve had around the clock since birth). THEN have your family say it was YOUR decision. The way they’ve treated Harry is just cruel.But I’m providing too much general commentary now 🙂Back to the book: I was NOT expecting Spare to be so…relatable. If you know what it’s like to lose a parent suddenly, or what it’s like to think “when this happens [I get married, have a baby, etc] this terrible familial relationship over here will be magically fixed” or what it’s like to fall out with family members, or what it’s like to be the subject of terrible rumors, or what it’s like to long for a solid committed relationship, or what it’s like to walk away from the thing that was basically your identity, you will find yourself in these pages. Don’t get me wrong. This is not a memoir about a perfect person. This is not the Bible and Harry is not Jesus Christ. He’s made mistakes. He has done dumb things. He has some reasonings that make no logical sense to me. At times, he paints himself as a selfless hero and others as cartoonish villains. He lacks touch with reality in some parts and he is “woe is me” in others. He gets a little TMI in his descriptions and he leaves big gaping holes of information in other descriptions. Plus, this is only one side of a complex story.However, he comes off as a great person! It’s sad that he was treated as a “spare” for his entire life. Wow, he has been through a lot and he has every right to tell his own story in his own words.This is a fantastic memoir, completely living up to its massive hype.

It was quite intriguing to hear about the ins and outs of palace life and his perspective on things.I gave this 5 stars because I personally enjoyed it and found it intriguing and overall I felt a bit more knowledgeable about palace life and the experiences Harry and his family have endured.On a personal note, I found the book a bit cringeworthy because I found it (at least seemingly) to be a major divide in the family with little room for repair. It was also very poor timing as far as the release being that the queen just passed away.

Rating 4 out of 5,"So I did it: I spent 20 dollars on Prince Harry’s book. I planned to read it super quickly so I could return it for a refund (just in case), but after reading it, I might let Harry keep my money and spend it on his private jets (not cool, by the way). Not only did I not want to finish it quickly, I physically couldn’t; he, or his ghostwriter, put so much effort and detail into the writing that it almost felt like fiction. In some ways, it would have been better if it wasn’t real, but I’ll get into that later. Want to know what the book was actually about without having to read it? Here you go. When I tell people I read Spare and that I feel sympathy for Harry, I often get the response, “Why? He’s a prince, he literally has everything,”. To that, fair point. He is a part of the most distinguished, and arguably the most famous of families in the world. Just by being born, he surpassed the majority of the world in wealth and social status. But putting his title aside, he is just another person trying to get by. Faced with PTSD, anxiety, and working through the lifelong grief of losing his mother, he goes through the same things as normal people do. He is placed in Eton, a school far too academically challenging for him. He works to find himself in a world covered in drugs and alcohol. He struggles, he finds love, and while he is still from one of the richest families in the world, blue bloods still bleed red. I was also incredibly surprised at how many people told me that reading Spare is a waste of time and that the whole thing is a 410-paged victim complex with a dash of superiority. Suddenly reading an excerpt meant reading the whole thing, and because Prince Harry had written it meant that all of it must be worded to make himself look the best. I would argue that this is a primary source, we can piece together events that prove that Prince Harry’s story can corroborate with real-time events. Of course, it’s biased; he is writing from his perspective, which will always be biased toward the writer. However, his own truth is the closest thing you can get to the truth when it comes to the Royal Family. He will make himself look better, and he will advocate for the good nature of his wife, that is just a fact. But looking into the other sources we have, most of them are filled with hatred and distaste for himself and Megahn, and are often inaccurate and filled with tales of those bought by money. Sure, we don’t need the truth, in fact, we have no right to it. This is a family, something considered sacred and private. But as Harry mentions throughout the book, the Royal family never actually gets any privacy while the press takes their lives and spins them through loop-de-loops of their own inventions. The press makes major appearances in Spare, and why shouldn’t it? They have followed Harry from the moment he was born, and have tormented and harassed him religiously. From being accused of being a drug addict to being “naughty” to comparing killing to being called a disgrace, Harry has seen it all. I found the stories he told not only about himself but Diana completely disgusting. I simply don't understand how someone could do that to another human being, and in reality, it’s probably because they don’t consider them human beings. And how much easier it is to bully and dehumanize someone from behind a keyboard or the lens of a camera. The press is a constant source of stress and conflict; with their mobs and raids of people’s houses, they destroyed lives for years. And all for money. Why do we feed into this? This endless hunger for gossip fuels that constant craving for cash. When are lines drawn? When does ruining someone’s mental health, someone’s life, become too much to cope with? I just can’t fathom it. It just doesn’t make sense to me, it can’t. Sorry for the quick rant, back to the book. Harry joined the army either because he didn’t want anything to do with further schooling or because it was just a way to branch out from his family. I think it was definitely a way for him to find peace, but also equality. Even though he was a prince, Harry trained with everyone else and worked like everyone else. But with his military experience, I try to take what he says with a grain of salt. He is experiencing Afghanistan from a British soldier's perspective, so of course he sees things a certain way. His descriptions of the Taliban killing British soldiers and how it enraged him felt truly emotional and patriotic, but also gave me pause. Harry killed 25 people. He admitted this, along with the fact that in order to kill someone, he couldn’t think of them as people. But wouldn’t the Taliban see him the same way? His ""chess pieces"" were people to someone, just like his fellow soldiers were people to him. I would also like to acknowledge that I know nothing about war; I don’t know anyone who has served, and I haven’t studied war and its effects on the human brain, none of it. I am, after all, a high schooler. All I can do is share my take on it and will be asking teachers and reading up on case studies and articles on the subject. Many people discredited or outright said the book was flawed based on one scene. I’ll call it “The Scene” because I am not describing it. Google it if you must. Honestly, it didn’t bother me that much. I actually thought it was kind of funny that he even included it. I could have definitely been shorter, I would say that. Details were included that didn’t need to be, so take that as you willOn a separate note, let’s talk about Meghan. A lot of people are now looking over the whole media circus that was 2020-2021 concerning Meghan. I’m kinda sad to say that at the time, I was definitely not a fan of hers, but then again, I knew nothing about her. I had no idea what Suits were, and all I saw was another actress trying to get into the Royal Family. What I didn’t take the time to consider is why I felt this way. Why was the press treating Meghan so horribly? It took me taking a step away to see the racism and misogyny that fueled the news. If a princess had been getting married to a man, I’m very sure that past relationships, “nudes” (that were fake), and all sorts of sexist propaganda would have not shown up. God forbid that Meghan wore the wrong hat or the wrong color; would that have ever been an issue with a man? Sadly, I did expect the racism, but I didn’t expect the lengths it went to. All because she was marrying the man she loved, she had to be bullied and berated to the point where she was considering suicide. I even just searched her name and this is still happening, most recently with Jeremy Clarkson. I still don’t know a lot about Meghan, but all I can do is sympathize with her pain and all of the abuse she has gone through. How we consume media, what we say about others, and the overall message. Looking back, I felt slightly disgusted with myself. I believed everything, and even worse, I had sought out news on the Royal Family, thinking that everything written had to be true. I wasn’t alive when Diana died, nor when new ideas were coming out about how we consume media. But in the new age of technology, I think we have to discuss it. As previously said, we have no right to the private lives of others, so why do we act like it? Why do we see fame as an all-access pass to a reality show that the cast didn’t consent to? And what about the things we say about others? How the way we describe and berate one another is simply commonplace. Everything from award shows to school dances to Instagram, we are displayed and critiqued like human canvases. When do we stop? When do we realize that we all bleed red, no matter race, sex, or social status? When do likes and fame stop controlling us? As I write this article, I’m taking a look at myself and the way that I treat others. How do I consume my news? Do I help feed into this critique, and if so, how can I let that go? While Harry and Meghan, and all celebrities, are in no way perfect (ahem private jets), starting off by looking at them as human beings rather than a net worth might start us on the right track. Whether or not you like Harry and Meghan, there story is an important one that shows us the power of media and its consequences.Show more",4,So I did it I spent 20 dollars on Prince Harrys book I

corroborate with realtime events Of course its biased he is writing from his perspective which will always be biased toward the writer However his own truth is the closest thing you can get to the truth when it comes to the Royal Family He will make himself look better and he will advocate for the good nature of his wife that is just a fact But looking into the other sources we have most of them are filled with hatred and distaste for himself and Megahn and are often inaccurate and filled with tales of those bought by money Sure we dont need the truth in fact we have no right to it This is a family something considered sacred and private But as Harry mentions throughout the book the Royal family never actually gets any privacy while the press takes their lives and spins them through loopdeloops of their own inventions The press makes major appearances in Spare and why shouldnt it They have followed Harry from the moment he was born and have tormented and harassed him religiously From being accused of being a drug addict to being naughty to comparing killing to being called a disgrace Harry has seen it all I found the stories he told not only about himself but Diana completely disgusting I simply dont understand how someone could do that to another human being and in reality its probably because they dont consider them human beings And how much easier it is to bully and dehumanize someone from behind a keyboard or the lens of a camera The press is a constant source of stress and conflict with their mobs and raids of peoples houses they destroyed lives for years And all for money Why do we feed into this This endless hunger for gossip fuels that constant craving for cash When are lines drawn When does ruining someones mental health someones life become too much to cope with I just cant fathom it It just doesnt make sense to me it cant Sorry for the quick rant back to the book Harry joined the army either because he didnt want anything to do with further schooling or because it was just a way to branch out from his family I think it was definitely a way for him to find peace but also equality Even though he was a prince Harry trained with everyone else and worked like everyone else But with his military experience I try to take what he says with a grain of salt He is experiencing Afghanistan from a British soldiers perspective so of course he sees things a certain way His descriptions of the Taliban killing British soldiers and how it enraged him felt truly emotional and patriotic but also gave me pause Harry killed 25 people He admitted this along with the fact that in order to kill someone he couldnt think of them as people But wouldnt the Taliban see him the same way His chess pieces were people to someone just like his fellow soldiers were people to him I would also like to acknowledge that I know nothing about war I dont know anyone who has served and I havent studied war and its effects on the human brain none of it I am after all a high schooler All I can do is share my take on it and will be asking teachers and reading up on case studies and articles on the subject Many people discredited or outright said the book was flawed based on one scene Ill call it The Scene because I am not describing it Google it if you must Honestly it didnt bother me that much I actually thought it was kind of funny that he even included it I could have definitely been shorter I would say that Details were included that didnt need to be so take that as you willOn a separate note lets talk about Meghan A lot of people are now looking over the whole media circus that was 20202021 concerning Meghan Im kinda sad to say that at the time I was definitely not a fan of hers but then again I knew nothing about her I had no idea what Suits were and all I saw was another actress trying to get into the Royal Family What I didnt take the time to consider is why I felt this way Why was the press treating Meghan so horribly It took me taking a step away to see the racism and misogyny that fueled the news If a princess had been getting married to a man Im very sure that past relationships nudes that were fake and all sorts of sexist propaganda would have not shown up God forbid that Meghan wore the wrong hat or the wrong color would that have ever been an issue with a man Sadly I did expect the racism but I didnt expect the lengths it went to All because she was marrying the man she loved she had to be bullied and berated to the point where she was considering suicide I even just searched her name and this is still happening most recently with Jeremy Clarkson I still dont know a lot about Meghan but all I can do is sympathize with her pain and all of the abuse she has gone through How we consume media what we say about others and the overall message Looking back I felt slightly disgusted with myself I believed everything and even worse I had sought out news on the Royal Family thinking that everything written had to be true I wasnt alive when Diana died nor when new ideas were coming out about how we consume media But in the new age of technology I think we have to discuss it As previously said we have no right to the private lives of others so why do we act like it Why do we see fame as an allaccess pass to a reality show that the cast didnt consent to And what about the things we say about others How the way we describe and berate one another is simply commonplace Everything from award shows to school dances to Instagram we are displayed and critiqued like human canvases When do we stop When do we realize that we all bleed red no matter race sex or social status When do likes and fame stop controlling us As I write this article Im taking a look at myself and the way that I treat others How do I consume my news Do I help feed into this critique and if so how can I let that go While Harry and Meghan and all celebrities are in no way perfect ahem private jets starting off by looking at them as human beings rather than a net worth might start us on the right track Whether or not you like Harry and Meghan there story is an important one that shows us the power of media and its consequencesShow more
Rating 4 out of 5,"First of all, the name of Harry’s memoir is so perfect. I don’t think he could have picked a better name for his book. I started it the day it came out and have been slowly plugging away on the audio all month, its a long one! Listening to it and hearing his story from his own words was so interesting. He was extremely heartfelt, admitted to his mistakes, and paints a very clear picture about why he felt he needed to step down from his royal duties. Certain parts dragged on and others I really enjoyed.

Rating 5 out of 5,"Very much enjoyed this look into the royal life and it's hypocrisy. I've always thought Prince Harry was fantastic, and real, and loved his missteps over the years because it showed just that. I have been a huge fan of him and Meghan and always thought they were wronged, but were remarkable in standing strong. He chose his wife, his love, his family, over a centuries old lame duck monarchy. I know Britons are mad, but here in America - we are smitten, we welcome him, and are happy he is here. May he, Meghan, and their children continue to build the life they want, a life they deserve, and more.

Rating 1 out of 5,"Oh Harry. Haz. H. Firstly, the writing: the book was ghost written by J. R. Moehringer, a Pulitzer prize winner and best selling author in his own right. The writing is actually really engaging and quite good and clearly not written by Prince Harry. Early in the book Harry laments his lack of patience in the classroom so the many Shakespearian references are a clear sign it was by written by our young prince. Much as been written in the media about Harry's claims, but do I believe them? Well, maybe some. I believe he believes them. I believe William has a temper, I believe they've had fights, and I'd even buy that Willy hit him. The fight between Kate and Megan probably would have been resolved without the brothers intervention. Megan is over friendly, crosses boundaries, Kate is reserved and uncomfortable with the hugs and comments on her hormones - something which might be OK between friends but might be seen as uncouth if you didn't know a person (similar to talking about your bolidy functions or todger in polite company). There's a lot of sibling rivalry which Harry boils down to ""the heir and the spare"" with no consideration that he's not just the spare, he's also the younger brother. I got my ears pierced when I was 6 while my sister had to wait till she was 8, and Willy had to shave for his wedding while Haz kept his beard. Sometimes life is unfair. There are many claims about the palace leaking stories, particularly Camilla. Harry makes a claim that Camilla leaked a story about first meeting William however doesn't mention that, at the time, Camilla’s personal assistant took responsibility for the leak (she’d told her husband, a media executive, who’d told a friend, who’d told someone at the Sun, who’d printed it). Do the royals leaks some stories, sure. Would Camilla sell out her husbands kids to reform her image? I don't know. Harry mentions falling in love with Megan's dog and caring for it because she loved the dog - when you love someone you love the things they love. Yet he can't fathom that feeling would also extend to your husbands children. If Harry can love a dog  why wouldn't Camilla care about Charles's children? I do believe that Harry felt hounded by the press and I'm sure they're horrible, but at the same time he says he's able to do his own shopping, go to TJ Maxx. He claims he was at Eton when the Queen mother died but he actually on a ski trip. He leaves William out of many stories, there are trips to America and South Africa they took together yet Willy isnt mentioned. While you can't dispute his feelings, Penguin could have got a fact checker for the timeline. Harry feels victimised by literally everyone, including his neighbours (for the sin of parking in his mother's old car park) but there's no mention of the absolute privlidge this boy is afforded. He is given jobs in the army others work hard for, he somehow rises to captain, however there is literally no mention of his army work while he is not in Afghanistan. What army work did he do when he was at home?! What's frustrating is his notion that the only role in the army is war. The army is involved in many humanitarian efforts, there are so many other roles he could have taken. He also has more leave than any serving defence member I've ever known. He travels the world, goes to the world cup, organises a concert to mummy, and works on the Invictus games - what army work is he doing?! H&M's claims about the royal family not taking mental health seriously is also questionable. When Harry talks to William about his anxiety William suggests talking to someone and recommends a doctor. Harry goes but refuses medication and therapy, choosing instead to meditate, which surprisingly does fuck all to help. When Megan weeps that's she can't go on, Harry suggests she stays home (by herself) while he goes to the theatre. This is also somehow the palaces fault, but if someone told me they were suicidal I wouldn't leave them alone. It also seems odd that Harry was able to find medical help for his todger and later find a therapist in secret, but was unable to find similar help for his wife. Now I'm not suggesting these stories about Megan feeling depressed aren't true because I'm sure she was, I'm suggesting Harry was weak and useless and didn't protect his wife. There are so many things which are factually wrong or don't align with previous interviews but the message is clear - Harry blames his brother for everything that has happened (and Camilla). If we are to believe his version of events Queen Elizabeth was a meek old lady, whose staff were taking advantage of her. I don't believe she was kept out of the loop of anything. Harry might be delusional enough to believe this book will somehow cause a reconciliation between the brothers but it's hard to see how. Harry comes off as privlidges, entitled, and whiney. He expects everything and sees anything not given to him as a slight. When Williams says he can't stay with Harry on the eve of his wedding Harry guilts him, saying he did that for William, just because William has 3 children and a newborn, doesn't change anything. Harry expects the palace (aka the tax payers) to foot his security and lifestyle in another country. He sees no difference to the palace ""leaking"" stories and him sitting sitting down with Oprah and claiming the royals are racist. When Camilla suggests Harry take on the role of Governor of Barbados (which actually sounded like a good option) he sees it as her trying to get rid of him. I thought Harry was an idiot before this book. I thought he didn't prepare Megan for the world she was entering. I thought she was an idiot for allegedly not googling the royals (yeah right). I thought he was selfish and entitled, and this book has confirmed that. While Megan may have her faults I think it's unfair she bears the brunt of so much hate when he is a complete twat who was only beloved because of his mother. One star, because I can't give 0stars .Show more",1,Oh Harry Haz H Firstly the writing the book was ghost written by J R Moehringer a Pulitzer prize winner and best selling author in his own right The

Rating 5 out of 5,"I would have given this book a four out of five because of the length and the fact that there were several things that could have been left out / edited however, I am going to give it five stars because I believe he deserves five stars as a human being. Notes-This is not a condemnation against a family, though personal and private conversations are printed to suit the narrative being told. -This is a telling of events, an explanation of why certain decisions were made, decisions that were, in some ways, 38 years in the making.-It is a strong condemnation against the British tabloid press. Lots of evidence cited depicting lies, sold stories, illegal action against the Duke and duchess of Sussex and other members of the royal family.-Although the story is one-sided, as the palace will not comment, there are receipts, statistics, and explanations littered throughout the book which led me to believe that Harry and Meghan's grievances are true. -This book was probably 100 to 200 pages too long and much of it could have been cut, although I heard they already cut about 400 pages from it. Harry just really really really wants to put everything out there lol. I did enjoy it and I am glad I read it but he didn't have to tell literally every detail (from peeing his pants to his frost bitten ""todger."")The Family-Harry depicts his father as a mostly loving, mostly trying father who did his best under difficult circumstances throughout most of his life. The biggest condemnations come through King Charles allowing stories to be planted about his sons that were untrue but painted him in a favorable light. This happened throughout Harry's life, and Harry believes this is mostly due to the influence of Camilla.-It is very clear that Harry loves his brother, but his disappointed by his lack of protection. It seems as if William is trapped by the expectation of being the heir apparent, that like many big brothers he feels both annoyance and love for his younger sibling. There is clearly jealousy on both sides as Harry readily admits and it is obvious that being told his whole life but his life was less valuable than his brothers from both the press and members of his immediate family. It seems as if William has jealousy of Harry's autonomy and freedom from the constraints of his position. -There seems to be a lot of misunderstanding and miscommunication between the brothers and King Charles. It seems that Charles and William are unsympathetic to Harry not tolerating abuse from the tabloids for him or his family anymore, especially the racial ones. They seem to think he needs to just get over it and roll with it because that is his job and they don't understand the depth of pain he's experiencing.Meghan Markle-Before I watch the Netflix documentary I tended to somewhat believe what was being reported by the press. I didn't dislike Meghan, but I wasn't an advocate for her either. Like many, I believe that there was a very real possibility she was dating Harry for the fame and position. I have done a complete 180 on Meghan Markle since watching the Netflix documentary and reading the book.-It seems clear to me that racism and sexism and even nationality has tainted Meghan's reputation. The fact that she is an American actress who has long championed civil rights issues and women's issues seems to be a mark against her. Much of the perceived slights against the monarchy seem to have derived from culture clashes between an open mouthed, unfiltered American and the buttoned up, proper Brits. -People say it's ridiculous to talk about racism when it comes to Meghan Markle, But the fact that the day after her son was born the British tabloids posted a picture of a couple with a chimpanzee saying that the royal baby was born speaks volumes. For court cases against the British tabloids there has been a lot of evidence cited with the lies and illegal actions taken against the couple.Meghan Markle cont...-So there are two camps, for Meghan and against Meghan. The people who are for Meghan are first hand sources, friends, family, co-workers, teachers, neighbors, former staff who all testify that the media is perpetrating lies against her. The people who are against Megan are the British tabloids/press, second hand or unnamed sources, and bots who have profited financially in creating the narrative of her villainy. Those who believe that she is a menace to the monarchy should ask themselves why they believe that, what media they are consuming. And those who don't have an opinion should perhaps listen to what the Royal couple is saying, look into the defamation lawsuit, and look at her career of charity work, women's rights, etc. Harry's Reputation -By no stretch of the imagination does Harry paint himself as a saint.  -He presents himself as a deeply flawed being who makes many many mistakes and carries a lot of regret for hurt and actions that he has done in the past. -He is open and honest about the truths of his life, But just as open about the lies perpetuated about him. He was known as the naughty Prince, the drug addled Prince, a dummy, reckless and angry, spoiled.  -He talked about some of the stories that were true and stories that were downright lies allowed to be printed to make his father and Camilla look like sympathetic creatures when he was a teenager. -He talks about his mother's death and how it has affected him throughout his entire life and how seeking therapy has allowed him to heal in some way.  -He talks about how he was looking for a wife and wanted to start a family for years and years but for so long he couldn't find anyone willing to

Rating 5 out of 5,"5 starsSpare is a brutally honest inside look at a harmful age-old institution, and no, I don't mean the British monarchy. A common assumption about this book is that its sole purpose is to air out the Royal family's dirty laundry. Make no mistake, some members of the royal family don't look so hot right about now, but the primary focus of this book is how the British Press, and its twisted relationship with the monarchy, has become emboldened and abusive over the past several decades, long before anyone had even heard of the name Meghan Markle.The story itself was very easy to read. The chapters are very short. The narrative is stripped down, almost conversational. I flew through the pages (figuratively, since I actually listened to the audiobook narrated by Prince Harry himself). There are three general sections of this book. The first section follows Prince Harry in his adolescent years after losing his mother, showing how the press became obsessive in casting him as the troubled prince. The second section focuses on his time in the British Army, a second home for him where he could finally release all the pent-up tension while still serving his country. Only in the final section do we see how his life changes when Meghan Markle crosses his path. If you ever have any interest in knowing what her true character is like, don't look for it online. Listen to the way her husband talks about her. That's all I'll say on that.Throughout the book we see some of the most famous moments of Prince Harry's life explained from his perspective. He addresses problematic events, like showing up to a Halloween party dressed as a Nazi or being photographed naked in Las Vegas. He doesn't shy away from owning those moments but gives it the context that any normal human would want to provide, which was something he was never allowed to do while part of the monarchy. Do I think he's a saint after reading this? No. Do I think there are more sides to the story than we see in this book? Of course. But the relief he felt just by getting to use his own voice when discussing these moments was palpable on every page.This book personally challenged me to better see public figures as people. It sounds so simple, but distance and mysticism allow us to sometimes pretend public figures don't have feelings, or even worse, somehow deserve the heat because they are famous. I think most rational people understand that tabloids aren't factual. Yet we still click the links, giving these sources ad money and justification to keep exploiting people. And it's not just tabloids and celebrities. How often do we click on some scandalous story about a political figure we don't like and take the words as fact, never bothering to hear context given from the person's own mouth. In fact, this book has encouraged me to seek out a few books written by public figures that I don't like just so I can give them the same opportunity to provide context.But most of all, what really inspired me about this book was the example Prince Harry sets in finding his own way. Sure, his story happened on a world stage, but his message is for all of us. You have a right to tell your side of the story. You have a right to resist gaslighting. You have a right to put the health and wellbeing of your family first, even when it conflicts with an institution or even a ""greater calling"". You have the right to choose your own way, regardless of what your neighbor or the entire world thinks of you.

Rating 5 out of 5,"I assume most people read this out of curiosity and a desire for good entertainment. The royals entertain us, and this book entertains in spades. It fulfills its purpose perfectly, so five stars for that.While Harry's disclosures might qualify as cringey over-sharing for an average person, for Prince Harry they are a reaction to living an entire life with the press prying into every aspect of his life. Each of the new stories in ""Spare"" is a story the press did not get to tell first. I could almost hear him sing-songing ""nah-nah-na-boo-boo""to the British tabloids with each tabloid-perfect revelation. How much money would the British press have made if they could have known Harry was intimately frost-bitten at William's wedding? With knowing a high Harry saw faces on Courtney Cox's bathroom garbage can? With knowing Harry peed in his pants before his first date with Meghan? As long as someone is profiting off of Harry's shame, it might as well be Harry himself.I also understand his complete infatuation with Meghan, the woman who filled the Diana-sized hole in Harry's heart. Obviously Harry's life appears to be a continual reaction to the loss of Diana, and when he finally found Meghan, he felt seen and fully loved once again. He can't bear that the same press that killed his mother also dragged his adored wife through racist, hateful mud. More than once I wondered if this entire book was Harry's attempt to deflect negative press off of Meghan and take it on himself. He couldn't save his mom, but if he can get the negative glare on Meghan refocused on himself, then maybe he can spare his wife some portion of the pain his mom endured.The tragic thing is that Harry appears to be one of the only people on earth that still loves Meghan. Her fall-out rate with staff, friends (including best friends) and family speaks for itself. And Meghan herself is happy to speak for all the rest. I personally was team Meghan right up until recently. I fully support Harry and Meghan doing what is right for their nuclear family, suing the press, and even profiting off of their own royalty and celebrity. Of course it is hypocritical for anyone who self-styles as ""anti-racist"" to also be so blatantly capitalistic, but this particular strain of hypocrisy is so garden variety that most don't even register it as contradiction. But after reading ""Spare,"" watching the Oprah interview, watching the Netflix series, reading the leaked Jason Knauff emails, and mulling over the fact that Meghan can't even seem to retain a best friend, I am no longer a Meghan fan. And in ""Spare"" Harry comes across as willing to divorce himself from reality in order to preserve his own fantasy of Meghan as saint.I also share Charles and William's bewilderment at Harry's vague accusations of ""planting and leaking of stories."" So far the only planted story that Harry has any proof of is the planting of the story that Kate made Meghan cry. According to Harry, the only person who would have leaked it was Camilla. Camilla may very well have planted this story, but Meghan's willingness to blow up the family on Oprah to correct this inaccuracy is, frankly, petty. Most of us understand the tabloids are fiction, most of us didn't really care about that story that much to begin with, and now that we all know the full story--texts and all--Meghan does not look any better. If anything, she looks worse. We've now all had a chance to read the text exchange, and very few of us can understand why Kate's terse texts (and Meghan's equally terse replies) were enough to leave Meghan sobbing on the floor. Kate's texts are Meghan's scapegoat to deflect attention from what was the real source of her unraveling. Her dad's willingness to sell out his own daughter to the press for money and the stress of preparing for the wedding generally was a lot, and Meghan's emotional breakdown was completely understandable under those circumstances alone. While Kate's texts might have felt to Meghan like the straw that broke the camel's back, these two women felt friction to begin with. It was a lot more convenient for Meghan to blame Kate for her tears than to focus on the other larger, more serious cause for her tears and stress.I do understand why Harry and Meghan decided to sell out Harry's family for money. When ""the Firm"" pulled their security at their most vulnerable time, Harry's family's actions literally endangered their lives. At that moment, I can imagine selling out to Netflix and a giant publisher felt necessary for financial independence and the ability to provide their children with ongoing security. Most people would do the same for their own kids given the convergence of extreme need and extreme opportunity. I personally don't judge that choice, but the whole world can see what a Faustian bargain it was.Also, as countless others have pointed out, Meghan and Harry are doing exactly what Meghan's dad did to Meghan. Since there is now almost zero chance for reconciliation on Harry's side of the family, perhaps Harry and Meghan can reflect on their own actions and use that as a starting point to reconciliation with Thomas Markle. Or, if they find that they can never trust Thomas Markle after what he did to them, then hopefully they will understand why the royal family can no longer trust them.Show more",5,I assume most people

Rating 4 out of 5,"I'm realizing it's not as easy to rate an autobiography as it is to rate any other type of book. 🙃What does one even rate?Do I rate their life?Do I rate the writer's retelling of their own life story?Do I rate whether they even wrote the book or if they hired someone else to write it? 👀In all seriousness, I have mixed feelings about this book. I'm not a royal fanatic by any means. I'm more intrigued by the family dynamic than obsessed with the drama. I have watched approximately 2 seasons of The Crown and still couldn't tell you half of what happens or who anyone is outside of the current heirs to the throne.And yet...I have been very interested in following Megan and Harry's efforts to ""tell their own story."" Ever since the explosive Oprah interview, I've been curious to know, exactly what happened with the dynamic between Harry and other members of the royal family? Were things really as bad with the press and with the palace as Megan and Harry claimed? Was there truly some racist conspiracy at play, or was Megan truly a bully? And WHO ON EARTH MADE THOSE EXPLOSIVE COMMENTS ABOUT THE COLOR OF ARCHIE'S SKIN? We may never know.I went into this book expecting a bit of eye rolling to occur, and perhaps even some annoyance. I wasn't a fan of the Netflix series and actually felt it did them no favors if sympathy and compassion are what they were hoping for. The book, however, actually did leave me feeling much more empathetic for Harry, Megan, and their situation. This isn't the explosive tell-all it was marketed to be, but we do get a glimpse inside of some of the personal slights that started to cause turmoil and friction, but not until the last quarter of the book.Approximately 100 pages are devoted to Harry's childhood and to processing the loss of his mother. It's evident how much Harry adored Diana, and it made quite a lot of sense why he has such a burning hatred for the press considering how his mother was treated in life and in death. This insight helped me understand just why Harry was so obsessed with correcting the narrative and calling out the overstepping of the British tabloids.I never understood why Megan and Harry seemed to care so much what was written, even if there were some terrible things written, because surely they knew that not everyone (even those who had read those articles) is spending every waking moment believing them and ruminating on them. But in light of understanding how his mother's death impacted him, and the anger he held towards the British tabloids for most of his life, it starts to make sense why their treatment of Megan would ignite such a fire in him that he would end up leaving the monarchy, even the country, in order to escape it.The portion of the book devoted to Harry's time in Afghanistan (about half) slogged on for me. You could feel how empty and depressing this time in Harry's life was. I do, however, admire that he willingly put his life at stake believing in a cause greater than himself. Not many royals can say they took their military service so seriously, or went to such great lengths to serve their country. For that I feel he deserves much more credit than he has received.The last 100 pages or so are devoted to his courtship and marriage to Megan. If you've watched the Oprah interview and the Netflix series, there's not too much you'll be surprised to hear. Just more examples of William and Kate being snobbish (not hard to believe) and Charles being cowardly in the face of having to choose between mitigating bad press for himself and his wife by leaking stories to the press or being a loving father who would never allow someone to say horrible things about your children for your own benefit (also not that hard to believe).I can understand why, when faced with the realization that his own family had been involved in leaking some of the awfully misconstrued or misrepresented tales of Megan to the press, he felt he could no longer maintain a healthy relationship.I can't imagine how tragic it must feel to spend your entire life isolated from the world in a glass castle, only to lose one parent at a young age and then to find out the other parent and your sibling are far more concerned about their reputations than their relationship with you.All in all, I was pleasantly surprised at how well this was written and how much empathy it caused me to garner for Harry.Show more",4,Im realizing its not as easy to rate an autobiography as it is to rate any other type of book What does one even rateDo I rate their lifeDo I rate the

Rating 4 out of 5,"I was sorely tempted to write, “I’m very glad Harry has people to hug and to hug him in return” and leave my review at that. But here are my thoughts!Harry (slash his ghostwriter) is a compelling storyteller. This book does what a memoir is supposed to do: tell a person’s story from their point of view in an entertaining and evocative way. It’s frequently funny, often grim, but always easy-to-read with a conversational flair. If I have a criticism of the writing, it’s that Harry seems compelled to make every anecdote Mean Something. Every chapter seems to end with a platitude, foreshadowing, or a sage metaphor about life. Chicken Soup for the Soul energy. It makes sense for Harry to map out his life this way psychologically speaking—I get the compulsion to make everything feel neatly interconnected and part of something bigger. But from a literary perspective, it can feel a trifle heavy-handed. If Spare has a thesis statement (other than “fuck the press”), it comes at the beginning of the book: “There's just as much truth in what I remember and how I remember it as there is in so-called objective facts.” I’m sure there are factual errors in this book, and perhaps it would have behooved his editor to stave off the inevitable nitpickers. But this book isn’t about what year the Xbox was released. It’s about emotional honesty and navigating traumatic memory. Much has been made about the cringe factor and pettiness in this book. It does read like Harry opened up his noggin and siphoned out everything directly onto the page. There’s also a fair bit of self-aggrandizing and even self-mythologizing, from bravely encountering creatures in the wild to gallantly saving a shopgirl from a rude couple. (To be fair, he does also take the piss out of himself to balance it out.) It’s naïve to think Harry exhaustively spilled the beans here, but this ultimately did feel like an intimate, forthright portrait of him and his history as he understands them at this moment in time. He has only just begun to unpack his shit and I’d be interested in the book he’d write in, say, ten years. Could you pry this kind of unflinching narration out of me? No!! But I’m also not in the position of wanting to enshrine my perspective on my own life in the public record. Simply put: couldn't be me but I hope it was liberating and cathartic for him. As for the pettiness, while there are some digs (I will never forget “alarming baldness, more advanced than my own” until my dying day), the gossipy juice has been greatly exaggerated. I don’t think this book is going to wildly move the needle with regard to opinions on any member of the British royal family. Everyone’s staunchest supporters will likely continue to feel how they’re going to feel. RIP to Camilla’s decades-long attempted rehabilitation campaign though lmao. I didn’t find any revelations particularly surprising, except perhaps that William and Harry don’t seem to have ever been truly close (the post-Meghan “riff” seems more like an amplified version of the status quo than an anomaly in their relationship). Charles is the most interesting character. It’s fascinating how Harry manages to both humanize Charles while also doubling down on his father’s loathsome parts. His Majesty the King seems to be a small, small broken man. If you’re hoping that Harry expresses anti-monarchist sentiments, you’ll be holding your breath. There is some surface scratching with regard to imperialism/colonialism but if you’re expecting Harry to be at the vanguard of the dissolution of the British monarchy… lol no. He makes abundantly clear that his enemy is the toxic interdependence between the British media and forces inside The Firm, but stops short of opposing the existence of the system itself. Disappointing, maybe, but not entirely unexpected given that it’s you know... his family. In a similar vein, Harry also does not cast a critical eye on the military. He’s a true believer in “the mission” and while he doesn’t glorify combat there is an obvious thread of patriotism in his chapters dedicated to his time in the armed forces. These chapters weren’t of particular interest to me personally, but I also acknowledge that they weren’t really For Me (he's said they’re for his fellow veterans). Anyway, I’m glad he left. I wish him and Meg and their kids and their chickens all the best.Show more",4,I was sorely tempted to write Im very glad Harry has people to hug and to hug him in return and leave my review at that But here are my thoughtsHarry slash his ghostwriter is a compelling storyteller This book does what a memoir is supposed to do tell a persons story from their point of view in an entertaining and evocative way Its frequently funny often grim but always easytoread with a conversational flair If I have a criticism of the writing its that Harry seems compelled to make every anecdote Mean Something Every chapter seems to end with a platitude foreshadowing or a sage metaphor about life Chicken Soup for the Soul energy It makes sense for Harry to map out his life this way psychologically speakingI get the compulsion to make everything feel neatly interconnected and part of something bigger But from a literary perspective it can feel a trifle heavyhanded If Spare has a thesis statement other than fuck the press it comes at the beginning of the book Theres just as much truth in what I remember and how I remember it as there is in socalled objective facts Im sure there are factual errors in this book and perhaps it would have behooved his editor to stave off the inevitable nitpickers But this book isnt about what year the Xbox was released Its about emotional honesty and navigating traumatic memory Much has been made about the cringe factor and pettiness in this book It does read like Harry opened up his noggin and siphoned out everything directly onto the page Theres also a fair bit of selfaggrandizing and even selfmythologizing from bravely encountering creatures in the wild to gallantly saving a shopgirl from a rude couple To be fair he does also take the piss out of himself to balance it out Its naïve to think Harry exhaustively spilled the beans here but this ultimately did feel like an intimate forthright portrait of him and his history as he understands them at this moment in time He has only just begun to unpack his shit and Id be interested in the book hed write in say ten years Could you pry this kind of unflinching narration out of me No But Im also not in the position of wanting to enshrine my perspective on my own life in the public record Simply put couldnt be me but I hope it was liberating and cathartic for him As for the pettiness while there are some digs I will never forget alarming baldness more advanced than my own until my dying day the gossipy juice has been greatly exaggerated I dont think this book is going to wildly move the needle with regard to opinions on any member of the British royal family Everyones staunchest supporters will likely continue to feel how theyre going to feel RIP to Camillas decadeslong attempted rehabilitation campaign though lmao I didnt find any revelations particularly surprising except perhaps that William and Harry dont seem to have ever been truly close the postMeghan riff seems more like an amplified version of the status quo than an anomaly in their relationship Charles is the most interesting character Its fascinating how Harry manages to both humanize Charles while also doubling down on his fathers loathsome parts His Majesty the King seems to be a small small broken man If youre hoping that Harry expresses antimonarchist sentiments youll be holding your breath There is some surface scratching with regard to imperialismcolonialism but if youre expecting Harry to be at the vanguard of the dissolution of the British monarchy lol no He makes abundantly clear that his enemy is the toxic interdependence between the British media and forces inside The Firm but stops short of opposing the existence of the system itself Disappointing maybe but not entirely unexpected given that its you know his family In a similar vein Harry also does not cast a critical eye on the military Hes a true believer in the mission and while he doesnt glorify combat there is an obvious thread of patriotism in his chapters dedicated to his time in the armed forces These chapters werent of particular interest to me personally but I also acknowledge that they werent really For Me hes said theyre for his fellow veterans Anyway Im glad he left I wish him and Meg and their kids and their chickens all the bestShow more
Rating 4 out of 5,"I listened to the audiobook of Spare, done by Prince Harry himself, and I really think this is the way to go with this book (and I am NOT an audiobook reader by nature). Hearing the emotion from the author (I understand it is ghostwritten but obviously with high collaboration and the stamp of Harry's approval) as he recounted his life events really heightened the experience and added nuance. He moves from his mother's tragic death through his tween/teen years at boarding school, his military and charity endeavors, talks briefly of each of the publicized girlfriends he had, his struggles with anxiety and royal life and into the beautiful instalove between he and Meghan, followed by the ugly reaction to it and their desperate, drastic escape to a safer and saner life. A central theme throughout the book are the truly ghastly interactions with the press he has dealt with his entire life, sometimes aided and abetted by his own family. You can hear the enmity he has for them, and rightly so. I admit to being a part of the problem with my love of celebrity gossip, but hearing this kind of nightmare existence makes me think long and hard about my participation in that culture. I hated the paparazzi/tabloids long before the end of this book, and can only imagine how much he and his wife do. The things he/they experienced (to say nothing of his mother, who was literally killed by them) are utterly reprehensible, and something should be done. The fact that his family did nothing despite their begging, repeatedly, and even participated in creating some of it... I can imagine how sad, scared and angry that would make him. At the same time, the love he has for his family is evident all the way through, which makes the ending all the more sad, and you can hear that it is for him too. Many of us have family who we love dearly, that we just cannot get along with or interact with for our own sanity - imagine that on their global stage!I think his love for Meghan and their kid(s) gave him the strength to leave the only life he had ever known, one he felt trapped in his entire life. I think she was the impetus for him jumping to another path, another way, even when they weren't sure how they could practically do it. His family and royalists make her out to be a villain for that, but no one could have sustained what they were dealing with for much longer, and I view them both as heroes for putting their mental and physical safety first against a centuries-old institution (referring to monarchy AND press). It seems like Pa and Willy are determined to be willfully ignorant in order to carry on the status quo and not face that a large part of the population, including them, are mired in internalized racism. Harry admits that he was, and that he has learned a great deal and continues to. The memoir really feels like a cathartic experience for him, beyond just an opportunity to finally set the record straight on many falsehoods that were told to and by the press throughout his life (something he begged for multiple times and was always told no on). >>>>>>>> Spoiler Sidebar: the fact his father allowed a false story about Harry to run deliberately to help Charles be viewed sympathetically when he was struggling with poor press about him when Harry was a teenager is one of the first - but far from the last - egregious things that happened to him personally - he was a child and his only parent was doing that deliberately! UGH) <<<<<<Despite there being some parts I wasn't highly interested in (the military details) and some parts being especially hard to hear (the turmoil and atrocious things he and Meghan went through), I think this is a very good memoir (and I don't read a lot of them). It has short chapters, it is well-balanced between light moments and hard ones, and it feels really, really authentic. Either he is one of the best actors who ever lived, or most/all of this is true (allowing some variance from his perceptions/spotty memory) and assuming that, the rest of his family (and dear God, the press) have a lot to answer for and change. I know it will never happen, but they should listen to it with open minds and make some changes before karma gets them.Show more",4,I listened to the audiobook of Spare done by Prince Harry himself and I really think this is the way to go with this book and I am NOT an audiobook reader by nature Hearing the emotion from the author I understand it is ghostwritten but obviously with high collaboration and the stamp of Harrys approval as he recounted his life events really heightened the experience and added nuance He moves from his mothers tragic death through his tweenteen years at boarding school his military and charity endeavors talks briefly of each of the publicized girlfriends he had his struggles with anxiety and royal life and into the beautiful instalove between he and Meghan followed by the ugly reaction to it and their desperate drastic escape to a safer and saner life A central theme throughout the book are the truly ghastly interactions with the press he has dealt with his entire life sometimes aided and abetted by his own family You can hear the enmity he has for them and rightly so I admit to being a part of the problem with my love of celebrity gossip but hearing this kind of nightmare existence makes me think long and hard about my participation in that culture I hated the paparazzitabloids long before the end of this book and can only imagine how much he and his wife do The things hethey experienced to say nothing of his mother who was literally killed by them are utterly reprehensible and something should be done The fact that his family did nothing despite their begging repeatedly and even participated in creating some of it I can imagine how sad scared and angry that would make him At the same time the love he has for his family is evident all the way through which makes the ending all the more sad and you can hear that it is for him too Many of us have family who we love dearly that we just cannot get along with or interact with for our own sanity  imagine that on their global stageI think his love for Meghan and their kids gave him the strength to leave the only life he had ever known one he felt trapped in his entire life I think she was the impetus for him jumping to another path another way even when they werent sure how they could practically do it His family and royalists make her out to be a villain for that but no one could have sustained what they were dealing with for much longer and I view them both as heroes for putting their mental and physical safety first against a centuriesold institution referring to monarchy AND press It seems like Pa and Willy are determined to be willfully ignorant in order to carry on the status quo and not face that a large part of the population including them are mired in internalized racism Harry admits that he was and that he has learned a great deal and continues to The memoir really feels like a cathartic experience for him beyond just an opportunity to finally set the record straight on many falsehoods that were told to and by the press throughout his life something he begged for multiple times and was always told no on  Spoiler Sidebar the fact his father allowed a false story about Harry to run deliberately to help Charles be viewed sympathetically when he was struggling with poor press about him when Harry was a teenager is one of the first  but far from the last  egregious things that happened to him personally  he was a child and his only parent was doing that deliberately UGH Despite there being some parts I wasnt highly interested in the military details and some parts being especially hard to hear the turmoil and atrocious things he and Meghan went through I think this is a very good memoir and I dont read a lot of them It has short chapters it is wellbalanced between light moments and hard ones and it feels really really authentic Either he is one of the best actors who ever lived or mostall of this is true allowing some variance from his perceptionsspotty memory and assuming that the rest of his family and dear God the press have a lot to answer for and change I know it will never happen but they should listen to it with open minds and make some changes before karma gets themShow more
Rating 4 out of 5,"Growing up American, there was not a lot of attention paid to the royals, though I remember seeing magazine covers during the Charles/Di divorce, and of course, her death. I was always mildly interested in Harry though, since he's only a couple months older than me, and apparently I found that a point of resonance. 😄 But like many, I found the unraveling of the fairy tale over the past few years compelling, and was looking forward to reading this, though with low expectations. Itwas more interesting and reflective than I expected (thanks to his ghostwriter) though it did have some weird/less effective stylistic choices sometimes-- it didn't detract overall from how I felt about the book.At the beginning, there was a lot that focused on losing his mom. Obviously and understandably, a huge moment in his life. Early on though, it felt a little self conscious: like, this is a THEME and remember you are reading about DIANA'S SON.The only person I thought he was really ""mean"" to was Will-- and that was so sad (he was vicious to a bunch of paps and aides too, but they unquestionably deserved it.) On the Oprah interview, he described that relationship as ""space"" and wowie, that's one way to put it. I don't think there's a lot of chance at reconciliation after publishing a book like this. I don't necessarily doubt the veracity of what he said about Will or Will's actions, but I do think that was the person who got the most selective edit and who would have the most interesting counter-balancing account (though he will never write such a thing!) Also, he was really mean about Will's baldness, which seemed unnecessary-- most British men eventually end up looking sort of like eggs, it just came for Will earlier than most. 😄He didn't say one single negative thing about his grandparents. That further reinforces my belief that he deliberately held off publishing this until the queen died. And for most of the book, I was surprised by his portrayal of Charles. I expected him to be a really shitty father during Harry's childhood, and he definitely had notable limitations. But it also seemed that he tried to be a good dad, and just simply never had the tools to do so because of his own upbringing. It felt like there was mostly respect for the good parts of his father and understanding of what drove him in a way missing from his portrayal of Will. There was LOTS to say about our media climate and culture of celebrity, on both individual victims and societies as a whole. I thought this was great. I'd learned about the Murdoch phone hacking scandal before and knew paparazzi was nuts before this, but it was chilling to read a detailed account of someone who lived it. Charles makes much in the book about his philosophy of ""Just don't read it,"" which seems callous at points, but I think must be the only real way to survive it. Of course, as Harry points out, the situation was different because of the *appalling* racist abuse Meghan received, and the dangerous loonies who were actively whipped up by those stories, a difference it seems Charles never fully appreciated. Also, there was surprisingly a lot about his military career, which I'd sort of assumed was mostly for show, but seems was maybe the healthiest environment he was ever in.There have been a lot of comments about how these are ""small"" problems for Harry to whine about, in comparison with things like, you know, war, starvation, etc. I don't think that's fair, because I think he's aware there are differences in scale there and acknowledges as much. But I also think it ignores that there are legit issues here: death threats, the massive platform given to disgusting racist comments, dehumanizing people for public consumption, what must become of societies that reward and don't hold audacious liars accountable.Overall, a really interesting, immersive read. It was sort of strange to read, because in many ways, none of those people seem real (which is part of his point about what dehumanizing press coverage does). It might have been better written in 10-20 years with a bit more perspective, but I completely understand why he chose to write and release it now.Show more",4,Growing up American there was not a lot of attention paid to the royals though I remember seeing magazine covers during the CharlesDi divorce and of course her death I was always mildly interested in Harry though since hes only a couple months older than me and apparently I found that a point of resonance  But like many I found the unraveling of the fairy tale over the past few years compelling and was looking forward to reading this though with low expectations Itwas more interesting and reflective than I expected thanks to his ghostwriter though it did have some weirdless effective stylistic choices sometimes it didnt detract overall from how I felt about the bookAt the beginning there was a lot that focused on losing his mom Obviously and understandably a huge moment in his life Early on though it felt a little self conscious like this is a THEME and remember you are reading about DIANAS SONThe only person I thought he was really mean to was Will and that was so sad he was vicious to a bunch of paps and aides too but they unquestionably deserved it On the Oprah interview he described that relationship as space and wowie thats one way to put it I dont think theres a lot of chance at reconciliation after publishing a book like this I dont necessarily doubt the veracity of what he said about Will or Wills actions but I do think that was the person who got the most selective edit and who would have the most interesting counterbalancing account though he will never write such a thing Also he was really mean about Wills baldness which seemed unnecessary most British men eventually end up looking sort of like eggs it just came for Will earlier than most He didnt say one single negative thing about his grandparents That further reinforces my belief that he deliberately held off publishing this until the queen died And for most of the book I was surprised by his portrayal of Charles I expected him to be a really shitty father during Harrys childhood and he definitely had notable limitations But it also seemed that he tried to be a good dad and just simply never had the tools to do so because of his own upbringing It felt like there was mostly respect for the good parts of his father and understanding of what drove him in a way missing from his portrayal of Will There was LOTS to say about our media climate and culture of celebrity on both individual victims and societies as a whole I thought this was great Id learned about the Murdoch phone hacking scandal before and knew paparazzi was nuts before this but it was chilling to read a detailed account of someone who lived it Charles makes much in the book about his philosophy of Just dont read it which seems callous at points but I think must be the only real way to survive it Of course as Harry points out the situation was different because of the appalling racist abuse Meghan received and the dangerous loonies who were actively whipped up by those stories a difference it seems Charles never fully appreciated Also there was surprisingly a lot about his military career which Id sort of assumed was mostly for show but seems was maybe the healthiest environment he was ever inThere have been a lot of comments about how these are small problems for Harry to whine about in comparison with things like you know war starvation etc I dont think thats fair because I think hes aware there are differences in scale there and acknowledges as much But I also think it ignores that there are legit issues here death threats the massive platform given to disgusting racist comments dehumanizing people for public consumption what must become of societies that reward and dont hold audacious liars accountableOverall a really interesting immersive read It was sort of strange to read because in many ways none of those people seem real which is part of his point about what dehumanizing press coverage does It might have been better written in 1020 years with a bit more perspective but I completely understand why he chose to write and release it nowShow more
Rating 2 out of 5,"After a week of listening to Harry narrate his way through “his” book – it was ghostwritten – I have some thoughts.Firstly, there is no denying that Meghan and Harry have been THROUGH it. Meghan’s continued mistreatment has been horrific. I admired her and her work before and after meeting Harry. Undeniably intelligent, kind, thoughtful and philanthropic, she’s clearly an honorary Brunch Book Club babe! I was and continue to be #TeamMeghanHarry also has traumas. There is no denying the pain and anguish he felt after his mother’s death (or “disappearance” as he calls it). He struggles to find his way through school and a path to his future before settling on joining the army, an experience that gives him purpose, family and brotherhood. Then he begins navigating life as a working royal under the scrutiny of the world. He’s right in describing his life as a gilded cage. And gilded it is. Lest we forget, each story, each tale is told to the backdrop of Balmoral, Eton, Sandringham, Botswana, Barbados, Buckingham Palace, all of the palaces; the list goes on.Harry says of his father’s relationship with the press “he hated their hate but oh how he loved their love” but listening to Harry for 15+ hours it’s clear that he too has an unhealthy obsession with the press – no one reads these stories more than he does. I can’t help but wonder if he would respond to incorrect press if it were positive with the same vitriol? Would he spend the majority of his book writing and critiquing them? No, probably not.There are many situations recounted that don’t ring quite as true as the pious tone he reads them with and this is my main issue with Spare. The overarching theme is ‘Truth’, that Harry and Meghan are its champions, bearing the burden and brunt of the press, soldiering on through the ‘war’, paving the way for others – yes, this is how it reads – but the book fails to take any real accountability for their own behaviours (I’m referring namely to Harry in this as it’s his story).Every situation is followed by a ‘but’ or an ‘I suppose’ as some means of mitigating responsibility, as though the acknowledgement is somehow akin to accountability. Take the physical altercation with ‘Willy’, it reads as William was unbridled with rage and Harry, the war veteran, “scared” but calm. There’s only the briefest mention of Harry’s also “raised voice” before he swiftly carries on describing the attack and his victimhood. Similarly, the many questionable decisions Harry made – wearing a Nazi uniform to a fancy dress party – are blamed on other people or explained away as the fault of external influences rather than accounted and apologised for. After so many of these tales it got tiresome and I found my eyes rolling – not an uncommon occurrence for me for sure.Overall, it’s an interesting insight to a family drama none of us really asked for. You can watch the Opera interview, the Netflix doc, the ITV interview, the 60 Min interview and you get the gist of the book. There are a couple of revelations that make the book worth reading but you can easily find them online. I really wanted to read an honest account of his life and experiences that shed light on an institution that we rarely see behind the curtain of. Instead I got a book pontificating about the woes of life, the joys of therapy, mindfulness and true enlightenment without any true accountability. Gone are the stains of his past, washed at high temperature of “unconscious bias”, “personal growth” and the fault of others. Already these small alterations are coming to light. New Zealand Air recently fact checking the claims of a “first class ticket” from Mexico to London, finding there is no such flight. I expect there’ll be a lot more of this.It’s a shame because I really wanted this book to “set the record straight” as it were but instead it has given ample opportunity to the naysayers and haters to poke holes and justify their unbridled hate. So, from now on, I will be checking out of this melodrama and I really hope they do too.This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review",2,After a week of listening to Harry narrate his way through his book  it was ghostwritten  I have some thoughtsFirstly there is no denying that Meghan and Harry have been THROUGH it Meghans continued mistreatment has been horrific I admired her and her work before and after meeting Harry Undeniably intelligent kind thoughtful and philanthropic shes clearly an honorary Brunch Book Club babe I was and continue to be TeamMeghanHarry also has traumas There is no denying the pain and anguish he felt after his mothers death or disappearance as he calls it He struggles to find his way through school and a path to his future before settling on joining the army an experience that gives him purpose family and brotherhood Then he begins navigating life as a working royal under the scrutiny of the world Hes right in describing his life as a gilded cage And gilded it is Lest we forget each story each tale is told to the backdrop of Balmoral Eton Sandringham Botswana Barbados Buckingham Palace all of the palaces the list goes onHarry says of his fathers relationship with the press he hated their hate but oh how he loved their love but listening to Harry for 15 hours its clear that he too has an unhealthy obsession with the press  no one reads these stories more than he does I cant help but wonder if he would respond to incorrect press if it were positive with the same vitriol Would he spend the majority of his book writing and critiquing them No probably notThere are many situations recounted that dont ring quite as true as the pious tone he reads them with and this is my main issue with Spare The overarching theme is Truth that Harry and Meghan are its champions bearing the burden and brunt of the press soldiering on through the war paving the way for others  yes this is how it reads  but the book fails to take any real accountability for their own behaviours Im referring namely to Harry in this as its his storyEvery situation is followed by a but or an I suppose as some means of mitigating responsibility as though the acknowledgement is somehow akin to accountability Take the physical altercation with Willy it reads as William was unbridled with rage and Harry the war veteran scared but calm Theres only the briefest mention of Harrys also raised voice before he swiftly carries on describing the attack and his victimhood Similarly the many questionable decisions Harry made  wearing a Nazi uniform to a fancy dress party  are blamed on other people or explained away as the fault of external influences rather than accounted and apologised for After so many of these tales it got tiresome and I found my eyes rolling  not an uncommon occurrence for me for sureOverall its an interesting insight to a family drama none of us really asked for You can watch the Opera interview the Netflix doc the ITV interview the 60 Min interview and you get the gist of the book There are a couple of revelations that make the book worth reading but you can easily find them online I really wanted to read an honest account of his life and experiences that shed light on an institution that we rarely see behind the curtain of Instead I got a book pontificating about the woes of life the joys of therapy mindfulness and true enlightenment without any true accountability Gone are the stains of his past washed at high temperature of unconscious bias personal growth and the fault of others Already these small alterations are coming to light New Zealand Air recently fact checking the claims of a first class ticket from Mexico to London finding there is no such flight I expect therell be a lot more of thisIts a shame because I really wanted this book to set the record straight as it were but instead it has given ample opportunity to the naysayers and haters to poke holes and justify their unbridled hate So from now on I will be checking out of this melodrama and I really hope they do tooThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilersShow full review
Rating 5 out of 5,"The reviews for this book are all over the place, and it seems they largely depend upon how you feel about the royals in general, and Harry specifically. I've always loved him and likewise, I loved this long book about his life. I've never thought highly of the British monarchy so was predisposed, I guess, to like this book. I learned so much about Harry that was new to me: his childhood, the great tragedy and resulting trauma of his mother's sudden death, the royal protocol, his years of active service in Afghanistan, and the horrors he and Meghan have gone through dealing with the constant hounding of the British tabloids and the paparazzi. I wouldn't take the life of a royal for all the tea in England.The two things that stood out to me were 1) how obviously he truly, deeply loves Meghan and wants to protect his family and 2) how sad it is that he was haunted by his mother's death for much of his life. He and William never saw their mother's body or had closure, and as a child, Harry believed for many years she had run away to escape the constant hounding of ""the paps"" and would be back. ""Maybe this is the day. Maybe she’s going to reappear this morning. This afternoon. It had been 4 years. Surely she had forged a new life and identity by now."" She had talked about it often enough, especially after the divorce from Charles. Maybe, at long last, she is going to emerge today, hold a press conference, shock the world and say 'William, Harry, if you can hear me, come to me.' For years he had elaborate dreams of triumphant returns. She was always wearing disguises, and he’d snap awake before he could find out where she’d been. Only a dream. Again. But maybe that means today’s the day. The illusion of his mother hiding, then returning, let him postpone the bulk of his grief. He never mourned, or cried, or processed the bare facts. This went on for many years, well into adulthood, and it wasn't until he sought therapy that he began to process his trauma. Reading about this just broke my heart. He loved being a British soldier in action on a battlefield. He was using all his skills as ""Widow 67"". He could hide behind this alias. He was just a random name and a random number. No royal title, and no bodyguard. He savored the normality. And asks: ""How abnormal was my life if that was the first place I felt normal?""He is honest about his wild years, doing drugs and drinking and making bad decisions and again, I felt so much of this was based on the unprocessed grief of the loss of his mother so young. He could never figure out why anyone wanted to be famous. ""Fame is the ultimate freedom? What a joke. Some kinds of fame may provide some kinds of freedom, but royal fame was fancy captivity."" And I would agree after listening to his story.The story of how Harry met Meghan and how they fell in love is a fairly normal story. What was NOT normal is the way the tabloids hounded them once their relationship became public. The press was beyond horrible to Meghan. Some of the lies they printed were beyond cruel and racist. The reporters investigated her and all her friends and family, and when they couldn't find the scandalous information they sought, they made it up. At that point Harry's sole goal in life was all about protecting Meghan. The second half of the book is about the hell they lived in throughout their courtship and marriage, constantly hounded by the same people who had caused his mother's death. And it's very obvious why they chose to escape the monarchy and move to the U.S. ""The press became Megologists who knew more about her than anyone else in the world, and they knew what they were printing were lies but they didn’t care."" Harry was desperate to sue the tabloids, but all his lawyers said if they sued it would simply feed the fire. Suing was what the papers wanted. They were hungry for him to sue. Harry was filled with rage and guilt. One of the saddest lines in the book was Harry saying “I’d infected Meg and her mother with my contagion, otherwise known as my life.” I am haunted by that comment, and belief.The royals’ policy had always been to do nothing. “Silence was the best option. Nothing can be done and therefore nothing will be done."" But not to Harry. He took on the tabloids and ultimately won, but he and Meghan paid a high price throughout all of this.I found the entire book fascinating, and listening to Harry narrate it in his own words was icing on the cake. I support all of his and Meghan's choices and hope that at some point they will have peace in their lives.Show more",5,The reviews for this book are all over the place and it seems they largely depend upon how you feel about the royals in general and Harry specifically Ive always loved him and likewise I loved this long book about his life Ive never thought highly of the British monarchy so was predisposed I guess to like this book I learned so much about Harry that was new to me his childhood the great tragedy and resulting trauma of his mothers sudden death the royal protocol his years of active service in Afghanistan and the horrors he and Meghan have gone through dealing with the constant hounding of the British tabloids and the paparazzi I wouldnt take the life of a royal for all the tea in EnglandThe two things that stood out to me were 1 how obviously he truly deeply loves Meghan and wants to protect his family and 2 how sad it is that he was haunted by his mothers death for much of his life He and William never saw their mothers body or had closure and as a child Harry believed for many years she had run away to escape the constant hounding of the paps and would be back Maybe this is the day Maybe shes going to reappear this morning This afternoon It had been 4 years Surely she had forged a new life and identity by now She had talked about it often enough especially after the divorce from Charles Maybe at long last she is going to emerge today hold a press conference shock the world and say William Harry if you can hear me come to me For years he had elaborate dreams of triumphant returns She was always wearing disguises and hed snap awake before he could find out where shed been Only a dream Again But maybe that means todays the day The illusion of his mother hiding then returning let him postpone the bulk of his grief He never mourned or cried or processed the bare facts This went on for many years well into adulthood and it wasnt until he sought therapy that he began to process his trauma Reading about this just broke my heart He loved being a British soldier in action on a battlefield He was using all his skills as Widow 67 He could hide behind this alias He was just a random name and a random number No royal title and no bodyguard He savored the normality And asks How abnormal was my life if that was the first place I felt normalHe is honest about his wild years doing drugs and drinking and making bad decisions and again I felt so much of this was based on the unprocessed grief of the loss of his mother so young He could never figure out why anyone wanted to be famous Fame is the ultimate freedom What a joke Some kinds of fame may provide some kinds of freedom but royal fame was fancy captivity And I would agree after listening to his storyThe story of how Harry met Meghan and how they fell in love is a fairly normal story What was NOT normal is the way the tabloids hounded them once their relationship became public The press was beyond horrible to Meghan Some of the lies they printed were beyond cruel and racist The reporters investigated her and all her friends and family and when they couldnt find the scandalous information they sought they made it up At that point Harrys sole goal in life was all about protecting Meghan The second half of the book is about the hell they lived in throughout their courtship and marriage constantly hounded by the same people who had caused his mothers death And its very obvious why they chose to escape the monarchy and move to the US The press became Megologists who knew more about her than anyone else in the world and they knew what they were printing were lies but they didnt care Harry was desperate to sue the tabloids but all his lawyers said if they sued it would simply feed the fire Suing was what the papers wanted They were hungry for him to sue Harry was filled with rage and guilt One of the saddest lines in the book was Harry saying Id infected Meg and her mother with my contagion otherwise known as my life I am haunted by that comment and beliefThe royals policy had always been to do nothing Silence was the best option Nothing can be done and therefore nothing will be done But not to Harry He took on the tabloids and ultimately won but he and Meghan paid a high price throughout all of thisI found the entire book fascinating and listening to Harry narrate it in his own words was icing on the cake I support all of his and Meghans choices and hope that at some point they will have peace in their livesShow more
Rating 1 out of 5,"I am so glad I haven’t paid for that.You know my usual rambling on how a personal story, an autobiography, is an opportunity to open the door to someone’s soul and have a peek at what this person you are interested in really feels and what is the true story behind him or her. You know what I think, having just finished reading and listening to Spare? I wish I didn’t open that bloody door.Puzzled, you might ask why I mentioned both reading and listening – I couldn’t cope with reading this graphomania and teleported straight into the stratosphere full of rage when I reached page 4 and threw the printout into the fire. I bet you’re still puzzled. Don’t worry, here is your unveiling – on page 4, Harry starts mourning that he had to leave his furniture behind when he left the country he was born in with his family. Furniture??? Bloody hell, I wanted to scream, I was flabbergasted.It took me several days to overcome the shock of the opening pages of Spare and I decided to give it another go – with an audiobook this time (I genuinely do regret spending my Audible points now). Pointless pompous whining flooded into my ears – about having less luxurious bedroom at Balmoral than William (seriously? he is obsessed with furniture, apparently), need to study (was it THAT surprising that you need an education?), being a younger brother (are you even for real?). Why the very idea of an heir and a spare was so shocking? Everyone knew the rules, after all, he has been born into a royal family from the very start.Holy mother of God, how overdramatic he sounded, I had to stop the recording multiple times at every go to be honest, ‘cause everything was just a tiny bit TOO MUCH. And I thought I sucked at our classes in phonetics at university. Even when he described the scene of Meghan giving birth to Archie, he does it in a stagey way, the whole event turns into a shite erotic novel scene within seconds. I wanted to puke. “Oh, we both loved the grilled chicken, I knew we were meant for each other” says he later breathily – are we supposed to gasp at it or what?Honestly, the whole “let’s publish a truthful book about me” agenda was organized for Harry to bathe in self-enjoyment [or whoever was this idea really] – the way he highlights his and Meg’s success and achievements (when in reality there are none) – e.g. when telling about his experience as a photographer in Botswana he mentions that they [the crew] never had to tell him anything twice (seriously? since when it is an achievement?). Or when he describes the moment when Meg had to curtsy in front of the Queen: everyone complimented her on the deep flawless curtsy. Flawless??? I am literally screaming inside. In this book, I want to scream at many things really - needless detailed descriptions of Meghan. Her makeup, type of the fabric her dress was made of, how her hair looked. How the whole country fell in love with Meg and her participation in the royal engagements was ALWAYS a triumph. Jesus, the very wording of it. If the whole book could have been cut down to the very last chapter on Meg’s suffering and being a “hero” at the same time aka the content of the Oprah interview, it would have saved up A LOT of paper. I suppose it might have even saved the poor structure of Spare as well ‘cause at times it was hard to follow since all the events and themes were all over the place in this book: in one episode he tells how they [with Meg] met the Queen and then goes straight and deep into accusing everyone in racism behaviour towards Meg. Has the editor even read the book? Was there an editor at all? I am not trying to be mean but it is a just ridiculously lousy written book. I have so many questions. So little answers. I am ready to set the bet that the whole editorial team of this book will forever remain on the Santa’s blocked list of contacts (not even the naughty one).

Rating 4 out of 5,"Spare is the story of Prince Harry's telling his truth of life in Britain's Royal family that spans from Princess Diana's death on August 30, 1997 to Queen Elizabeth II's death on September 8, 2022. The memoir is broken into three parts: life after Princess Diana's death, his military career, and his romantic relationship / marriage to Meghan Markle. I read the memoir with an open mind, but I did take his account with a grain of salt, because every family has dysfunction, and like the old adage states that there is always three sides to every story: his, theirs (the Royal family), and the truth (which no one but Harry, the Royal family, and Royal insiders really know). That being said, I was still curious enough to read what Prince Harry had to say in his memoir, and I came away with the feeling that his life journey has been an emotional roller coaster ride that encompasses the full gamut of emotions. Spare starts out with the princes finding out from Prince Charles that Princess Diana has been killed in an automobile accident in Paris on August 30, 1997. Prince Harry was tweleve years of age when his mother died, and the reader can't help but understand how her death completely changed his life. Throughout the book, Harry's grief over the death of his mother is palpable, he did not believe she died until 2007 when he visited Paris and drove through the tunnel that he got a painful reality and closure. The second part of the book focuses on life after Princess Diana and his life in the Royal family. Prince Harry acknowledges that he did not enjoy living in the regimented life within the Royal fish bowl, and not having a normal life. He was not a good student, prone to panic attacks and low self-esteem, and had to deal with the Heir vs. Spare sibling rivalry and competitveness with Prince William. He also yearned for a close father-son relationship with Prince Charles, but his father was reserved and not one to express affection. The main theme throughout the memoir is devoted to Prince Harry's dislike and contempt for the paparazzi and their headlines and stories that often put him in a terrible light with the public (his naughty Harry partying days), and how the paparazzi was always ruthlessly stalking the Royal family, from his school days to his military career to his marriage to Meghan. He can't understand the Royal family's motto of never complain, never explain, and their complicity toward the media. It is this complicity and the fear for his family's safety that eventually leads Prince Harry and Meghan to leave the Royal family for the US. But underneath the surface is also his strained relationship with Prince Charles and Prince William that led him to write this memoir. I think that Prince Harry's recollections and shade towards his family will only lead to a permanent rift, there really was no need to air the family's personal business to the public. Writing Spare may have been cathartic for Prince Harry to release his personal demons, but I don't think it will fare well in the long run, what a shame. What he could have done is just put the Royal life behind him, and live the normal life that he and Meghan wanted without the public snark and money schemes that this memoir, the Netflix documentary, and subsequent media publicity has created, especially since he spouted his comtempt for the paparazzi and publicity throughout the book. I enjoyed his memory of Princess Diana, but the rest of his story is just a sad account of a man that had a hard time finding himself within his family. https://jerseygirlbookreviews.blogspo...Show more",4,Spare is the story of Prince Harrys telling his truth of life in Britains Royal family that spans from Princess Dianas death on August 30 1997 to Queen Elizabeth IIs death on September 8 2022 The memoir is broken into three parts life after Princess Dianas death his military career and his romantic relationship  marriage to Meghan Markle I read the memoir with an open mind but I did take his account with a grain of salt because every family has dysfunction and like the old adage states that there is always three sides to every story his theirs the Royal family and the truth which no one but Harry the Royal family and Royal insiders really know That being said I was still curious enough to read what Prince Harry had to say in his memoir and I came away with the feeling that his life journey has been an emotional roller coaster ride that encompasses the full gamut of emotions Spare starts out with the princes finding out from Prince Charles that Princess Diana has been killed in an automobile accident in Paris on August 30 1997 Prince Harry was tweleve years of age when his mother died and the reader cant help but understand how her death completely changed his life Throughout the book Harrys grief over the death of his mother is palpable he did not believe she died until 2007 when he visited Paris and drove through the tunnel that he got a painful reality and closure The second part of the book focuses on life after Princess Diana and his life in the Royal family Prince Harry acknowledges that he did not enjoy living in the regimented life within the Royal fish bowl and not having a normal life He was not a good student prone to panic attacks and low selfesteem and had to deal with the Heir vs Spare sibling rivalry and competitveness with Prince William He also yearned for a close fatherson relationship with Prince Charles but his father was reserved and not one to express affection The main theme throughout the memoir is devoted to Prince Harrys dislike and contempt for the paparazzi and their headlines and stories that often put him in a terrible light with the public his naughty Harry partying days and how the paparazzi was always ruthlessly stalking the Royal family from his school days to his military career to his marriage to Meghan He cant understand the Royal familys motto of never complain never explain and their complicity toward the media It is this complicity and the fear for his familys safety that eventually leads Prince Harry and Meghan to leave the Royal family for the US But underneath the surface is also his strained relationship with Prince Charles and Prince William that led him to write this memoir I think that Prince Harrys recollections and shade towards his family will only lead to a permanent rift there really was no need to air the familys personal business to the public Writing Spare may have been cathartic for Prince Harry to release his personal demons but I dont think it will fare well in the long run what a shame What he could have done is just put the Royal life behind him and live the normal life that he and Meghan wanted without the public snark and money schemes that this memoir the Netflix documentary and subsequent media publicity has created especially since he spouted his comtempt for the paparazzi and publicity throughout the book I enjoyed his memory of Princess Diana but the rest of his story is just a sad account of a man that had a hard time finding himself within his family httpsjerseygirlbookreviewsblogspoShow more
Rating 4 out of 5,"I am so conflicted about this book. Normally, I only rate memoirs based on the writing and the power of the storytelling. And quite frankly, the writing in this is phenomenal. Hats off to the ghost writer. Which is not something I hold against Prince Harry, I think it's best for all of us that it was ghost written. And truly, the writing is impeccable. It's engaging, it's just the right amount of detailed, and the structure, while drags a bit in the middle, is actually quite good. The writing by itself is a 4.5 to 5 stars, easy. However, because of the subject matter, I don't think this can be evaluated simply on its writing. This is not a normal memoir. Prince Harry, more than most memoirists, has something to gain from this. Do I necessarily think that everything he says is the whole truth and nothing but the truth? Not beyond the shadow of a doubt. But do I think that he has any more reason to lie than the monarchy does? I've thought about it a lot, and my answer is no. Thus, I did find myself inclined to give his account the benefit of the doubt. Part of that is my own bias of not believing in the political utility of a monarchy in the 21st century. And I will admit, this memoir pretty much just reinforced my own opinions of how problematic the institution of the monarchy is. Because, quite frankly, the best way to describe this book is that it's Pretty Fucking Sad. If he was not a prince and he was just a regular person who was constantly told that his life was less important and less worth protecting than both his father's and his brother's (he offhandedly mentions that no one would ever allow Charles and William to fly on the same plane so they wouldn't die at the same time, but no one cared what plane Harry was on), and then at 12, he horrifically loses his mother, who was the only person in his family who seemed to love him openly and was not fundamentally emotionally stunted (he at one point says that he father gave him a salute and it felt like a hug)... You'd feel pretty bad for that child. And it would explain, if not excuse, a lot of his actions. Then add on that the same media apparatus that contributed to his mother's death, hunts and stalks him through his entire adolescence, culminating in his future wife being the target of vile racist remarks and them being terrified for them and their children's lives... I kinda get it. On the other hand, did I love the glorification of his time in the military and the wars that were being fought in the Middle East during his tenure in the army? Hard no. I can sort of, kind of respect that it gave him a purpose and grounded him outside of being a member of the monarchy. But I can't support that aspect of this story and also be staunchly be opposed to the monarchy, in part because of the history of forceful military power and colonization. While Prince Harry (and his ghost writer) never fully comes out and say that he doesn't believe the monarchy should exist, I came away with the understanding that he does think it is a fundamentally flawed institution, perhaps beyond repair. And despite that, it is quite apparent that he had a great deal of fondness for his family, particularly his grandmother, but also, albeit in a more complicated way, for his father and brother as well. All of this to say, I'm giving this four stars. I think it's well written and if the subject matter interests you, it's probably worth your time. It is not without its faults, but that would be a lot to ask of a book of this nature. I'll finish this by saying that opinions are like... well, you know. I don't think my opinion is more important than anyone else's (for the most part). But given the fact that, at first, I didn't even think I'd pick this up, I came away quite impacted by this book. I, clearly, have a lot of opinions about it. So take that for what it is. I promise to never write a review this long ever again.

Rating 3 out of 5,"This is the kind of celebrity memoir, I think, that demands an introduction—or maybe 'disclaimer' is a better word—before we dive into it. Something like, ""Hi, my name is Taylor, I'm an American who went to university in London, so while I've acquired that weird British fondness for the late Queen Elizabeth which renders her character utterly impeachable, I also believe the monarchy as an institution is utter trash, completely unnecessary in this day and age, and should definitely be abolished at some point in my lifetime, if all goes well""?Okay? Glad we've cleared that up.It's extremely telling, I think, that SPARE begins with Harry's recollection of Diana's death.In no uncertain terms, it screams, ""This is it. This is the pivotal moment around which his entire life, for good or ill, has orbited."" That fact alone is not entirely unexpected, but laid bare for us in his own voice, it's impossible not to feel extraordinarily sad for him, that he was forced to shoulder the unenviable burden of that tragedy as an emotionally undeveloped 12-year-old (to say nothing of the added burden of an entire world's grief), then denied by his own family any opportunity to learn how to productively cope with his feelings about it.It's also extraordinarily frustrating to be a bystander with a limited understanding of trauma (derived totally from personal experience, lest anyone think I'm any sort of qualifed mental health professional; I am not) and see clearly the moments when Harry's trauma, combined with his lack of productive coping mechanisms, gets the better of him. He is constantly overthinking conversations, events, even the briefest and smallest of interactions or gestures (the effect of which, on the page, is buffeted by his ghostwriter's chosen pseudo-stream-of-consciousness style), to the extent that it's not always clear where commonsense facts and statements are meeting and blending with Harry's own personal bias. For example, much of what he has to say about his family, even the most scandalous stories that were already leaked during the press tour, remains open to interpretation; he provides no substantial proof or evidence of his claims and accusations, even the most damning ones against Charles and Camilla regarding their relationship with the press. Even the best ghostwriter in the world couldn't fully or sufficiently replicate the tone of a conversation, which is often crucial in exchanges of this nature. All of which is to say, if he intended this book to serve as a decisive take-down of his family and the institution surrounding them, it fell flat.I question his ability to be objective about the events he's retelling here (because, let's face it, when it's your own life, objectivity is a fucking tall order, some might even say impossible).I question whether this would read as the same book if he'd written it in five years' time, after more healing.I question whether he's still getting the kind of help and guidance that he obviously needs, even now that he’s managed to escape his family situation. Of course, it’s his prerogative to decide the extent to which he wants to be open about whatever mental health treatment he may or may not be receiving, but I admit, I did find it slightly troubling that he spoke about this aspect of his experience so little when the razorlight focus of this book was, essentially, his mental health.I applaud Harry's desire to reclaim his personal story (which he is completely entitled to) and be a truth-teller, but the old adage immediately comes to mind: There's your truth, my truth, and then there’s 'the' truth. It would be ridiculous of anyone to assume that we've gotten the full truth here... or that we ever will, from anyone. Bearing that in mind, I'm tuning out.Show more",3,This is the kind of celebrity memoir I think that demands an introductionor maybe disclaimer is a better wordbefore we dive into it Something like Hi my name is Taylor Im an American who went to university in London so while Ive acquired that weird British fondness for the late Queen Elizabeth which renders her character utterly impeachable I also believe the monarchy as an institution is utter trash completely unnecessary in this day and age and should definitely be abolished at some point in my lifetime if all goes wellOkay Glad weve cleared that upIts extremely telling I think that SPARE begins with Harrys recollection of Dianas deathIn no uncertain terms it screams This is it This is the pivotal moment around which his entire life for good or ill has orbited That fact alone is not entirely unexpected but laid bare for us in his own voice its impossible not to feel extraordinarily sad for him that he was forced to shoulder the unenviable burden of that tragedy as an emotionally undeveloped 12yearold to say nothing of the added burden of an entire worlds grief then denied by his own family any opportunity to learn how to productively cope with his feelings about itIts also extraordinarily frustrating to be a bystander with a limited understanding of trauma derived totally from personal experience lest anyone think Im any sort of qualifed mental health professional I am not and see clearly the moments when Harrys trauma combined with his lack of productive coping mechanisms gets the better of him He is constantly overthinking conversations events even the briefest and smallest of interactions or gestures the effect of which on the page is buffeted by his ghostwriters chosen pseudostreamofconsciousness style to the extent that its not always clear where commonsense facts and statements are meeting and blending with Harrys own personal bias For example much of what he has to say about his family even the most scandalous stories that were already leaked during the press tour remains open to interpretation he provides no substantial proof or evidence of his claims and accusations even the most damning ones against Charles and Camilla regarding their relationship with the press Even the best ghostwriter in the world couldnt fully or sufficiently replicate the tone of a conversation which is often crucial in exchanges of this nature All of which is to say if he intended this book to serve as a decisive takedown of his family and the institution surrounding them it fell flatI question his ability to be objective about the events hes retelling here because lets face it when its your own life objectivity is a fucking tall order some might even say impossibleI question whether this would read as the same book if hed written it in five years time after more healingI question whether hes still getting the kind of help and guidance that he obviously needs even now that hes managed to escape his family situation Of course its his prerogative to decide the extent to which he wants to be open about whatever mental health treatment he may or may not be receiving but I admit I did find it slightly troubling that he spoke about this aspect of his experience so little when the razorlight focus of this book was essentially his mental healthI applaud Harrys desire to reclaim his personal story which he is completely entitled to and be a truthteller but the old adage immediately comes to mind Theres your truth my truth and then theres the truth It would be ridiculous of anyone to assume that weve gotten the full truth here or that we ever will from anyone Bearing that in mind Im tuning outShow more
Rating 1 out of 5,"I finished this a few days ago, but the review has taken a bit to write. Like this book, it will be repetitive, messy, and a full scale rant :) First, I grew up hearing about Princess Diana’s death and seeing the image of the two boys at her funeral that Harry loved to refer to many times in this memoir. I completely sympathize with Harry’s loss and can understand how the loss could explain some of his behavior. Notice that I said “explain”, not “justify”. “Some”, not “all”. My guy Harry has not learned these differences. I will acknowledge that he’s been through a lot. His family was no help and the press was atrocious in their conduct. I wouldn’t wish that on anyone, and tbh, I’d feel bad if he wasn’t so bratty to be quite frank. I really dislike people who can’t see any fault of theirs—constantly blameless. The whole book feels like a pity party for Harry where he tries to convince the readers to feel bad for him. Like the fact that he’s third in line for the throne is supposed to make me feel bad for him? Okay, buddy. Though Harry experienced a major loss as a child (and I won’t deny that the British press and his family also suck big time), this loss was used as a villain origin story to justify his crappy behavior later on. Same with him being the “spare”. He was and is so oblivious to the privilege he has in what he was able to get away with in adolescence that my peers and I could never dream of doing. His past actions are whatever. Everyone makes mistakes. Whatever. The problem was how he responded to them and discussed them in retrospect. He argued for reflection and introspection to grow, but didn’t seem to apply that to himself with the whole Nazi thing and racial slur in his early twenties. He was kind of apologetic but mostly talked about ignorance and didn’t really take any personal responsibility. Ignorance is not a valid excuse here. You were an adult, my guy. Accountability was never there. He mainly just blamed the way he was raised, the sense of being lost from losing his mother, etcetera. There was always some other excuse for his behavior. A bigger issue to me was just what the book was supposed to tell me. It seemed that Harry was talking smack about everyone in the RF. He went at William and Kate a bit excessively considering his own actions. They may be problematic in their own ways, but his actions (Nazi costume) are his own. OWN YOUR MISTAKES BRO. Also bro really still has some kind of sibling rivalry with William as a full grown man like-For all of his hate towards the media, he’s fueling their fire by writing this book through all the crap-talking that happens. Idk. Felt a bit off imo. Also, his bragging about killing those 25 Taliban “baddies” (like wth) and comparing them to chess pieces is just indescribable. I began to see the ""red mist"" that Harry so clearly described. They were terrorists, but let’s not do that, my guy. Point? This felt like Harry ranting about the RF and airing out all of their dirty laundry. The only central message I got was that everyone sucks. There was no clear purpose. Do you like big drama and don’t care about a sucky personality writing this? Read this. He seemed immature too. Like more immature than me (which is saying something). Like idc about his excuses. Idc about the excessive references to his genitals. Idc about all the drugs he did among other stupid things. Like my friend, you don’t have to constantly be describing the weed. We get it. You were an addict and it definitely seems like it screwed with your head to get you to almost brag about these issues. To reiterate: Book is grounded in immature writing (ironic as Harry DEFINITELY wrote the entire book) and Harry is deeply unaware of the privilege he has. The sheer amount of entitlement was just so annoying. In terms of whether it did its job as a memoir, sure it did. Hopefully this experience was cathartic for Harry. This book is not worth wasting money over. W library for buying 25 copies but also L library for wasting their money.Show more",1,I finished this a few days ago but the review has taken a bit to write Like this book it will be repetitive messy and a full scale rant  First I grew up hearing about Princess Dianas death and seeing the image of the two boys at her funeral that Harry loved to refer to many times in this memoir I completely sympathize with Harrys loss and can understand how the loss could explain some of his behavior Notice that I said explain not justify Some not all My guy Harry has not learned these differences I will acknowledge that hes been through a lot His family was no help and the press was atrocious in their conduct I wouldnt wish that on anyone and tbh Id feel bad if he wasnt so bratty to be quite frank I really dislike people who cant see any fault of theirsconstantly blameless The whole book feels like a pity party for Harry where he tries to convince the readers to feel bad for him Like the fact that hes third in line for the throne is supposed to make me feel bad for him Okay buddy Though Harry experienced a major loss as a child and I wont deny that the British press and his family also suck big time this loss was used as a villain origin story to justify his crappy behavior later on Same with him being the spare He was and is so oblivious to the privilege he has in what he was able to get away with in adolescence that my peers and I could never dream of doing His past actions are whatever Everyone makes mistakes Whatever The problem was how he responded to them and discussed them in retrospect He argued for reflection and introspection to grow but didnt seem to apply that to himself with the whole Nazi thing and racial slur in his early twenties He was kind of apologetic but mostly talked about ignorance and didnt really take any personal responsibility Ignorance is not a valid excuse here You were an adult my guy Accountability was never there He mainly just blamed the way he was raised the sense of being lost from losing his mother etcetera There was always some other excuse for his behavior A bigger issue to me was just what the book was supposed to tell me It seemed that Harry was talking smack about everyone in the RF He went at William and Kate a bit excessively considering his own actions They may be problematic in their own ways but his actions Nazi costume are his own OWN YOUR MISTAKES BRO Also bro really still has some kind of sibling rivalry with William as a full grown man likeFor all of his hate towards the media hes fueling their fire by writing this book through all the craptalking that happens Idk Felt a bit off imo Also his bragging about killing those 25 Taliban baddies like wth and comparing them to chess pieces is just indescribable I began to see the red mist that Harry so clearly described They were terrorists but lets not do that my guy Point This felt like Harry ranting about the RF and airing out all of their dirty laundry The only central message I got was that everyone sucks There was no clear purpose Do you like big drama and dont care about a sucky personality writing this Read this He seemed immature too Like more immature than me which is saying something Like idc about his excuses Idc about the excessive references to his genitals Idc about all the drugs he did among other stupid things Like my friend you dont have to constantly be describing the weed We get it You were an addict and it definitely seems like it screwed with your head to get you to almost brag about these issues To reiterate Book is grounded in immature writing ironic as Harry DEFINITELY wrote the entire book and Harry is deeply unaware of the privilege he has The sheer amount of entitlement was just so annoying In terms of whether it did its job as a memoir sure it did Hopefully this experience was cathartic for Harry This book is not worth wasting money over W library for buying 25 copies but also L library for wasting their moneyShow more
Rating 4 out of 5,"Somewhere in the middle of Spare, Harry makes an interesting comparison between the dehumanization of “the enemy” he had to do in war and the way the press dehumanizes the RF. I think we can extend that to most famous people — it’s very easy to dehumanize these rich, often out of touch, celebrities. And the Royal Family is a whole other level of that, tied up in government subsidy, world atrocities, and intrigue that goes beyond a movie star.I think M&H’s critics should consider that element more — how much are we reading into who these people are from stories and interviews that can never really give a full picture of a person? How much easier is it to make a judgment about what someone’s inner desires and beliefs are than considering them to be a whole person who we cannot possibly know from afar? I never have gotten the sense that either M or H love the press or the spotlight. I think they are people who have had immense privilege, yes, but who want to do good in the world and who welcome a platform to do so, but who understand there’s a difference between regular fame and having paps ringing your doorbell until midnight and chasing you through the streets.While I do think Harry has some moments in Spare where his privilege is something he is clearly still working through (around his education and patriotism at war, namely), I admire him and how much self work he’s clearly done. He acknowledges several moments where his old way of thinking would never mesh with the man he’s become, and he speaks honestly of accountability and growth.I can’t imagine having been born into a life with no control, no privacy, and constant lies being spouted out to everyone on earth about you. The family life seems equally hellish — competition, formality — his dad told him his mother died in the middle of the night and then left him alone for hours with that news. The trauma of knowing your mother was essentially tortured to death and never getting real answers or accountability for that. Watching that same press harassment ruin every relationship you’ve had, and watching it fully break down someone else you love, your wife. Feeling safer in a war zone than in your own home city. There was clearly always a rivalry between brothers and even between father and sons that was more a product of the institution itself than who these people are inherently. When your family is a part of every aspect of life, an extremely public life you never opted into, what can be sacred, really?The portrait we get of Harry is someone much more comfortable outdoors than in the royal cage, who wants to use his platform for good and to be a father most of all. I genuinely hope he and Meg and the kids will be happy, and can continue serving the world in a way that makes them happy and does good.

Rating 2 out of 5,"Had I read this as an audiobook, I might of had a different reaction to the book. Certainly, Prince Harry writing and structuring the book the way he thinks and speaks, even to tell his story, I think in this case for me as the reader, did not help him in his attempt to tell his story. While this is a memoir (since its a glimpse into his life thus far to correct the public narrative surrounding him and his now immediate family) the book unfortunatley opens him up to the privacy issue that is a constant refrain in the book - while the book (and previous Netlfix doc) allow the Sussexes to craft their own narrative (and a source of income) while here in the States as is their right, it also puts them back into the public with the same level of scrutiny and attention. Book Harry lays out his life in general epochs: life with Princess Diana, life post Princess Dianan but pre-military, military service and finding his role as the ""Spare"", and then meeting Meghan Markle and his subsequent marriage and starting a family with her, which brings us to the present as a non-active member of the royal family while his father, King Charles III prepares for his ascension to the throne. While not getting into the somewhat dogmatic obsession with fact checking the man on everything that he was able to word vomit (mans really said I am gonna set the record straight on a lot of things) and I can see how the book might have served in a cathartic manner for him to grapple and make peace with how many parts of his life have shaped out. However, much like his life in his own words, ""Spare"" lacks that central focus or tenant that is able to tie the various musings of his life together. Perhaps because its more recent, but you can see that when Prince Harry is describing meeting Meghan and moving forward from that meeting, that there is a central theme. Indeed, even when talking about his grief surrounding the death of his mother, you can also see a central theme or pattern emerge. However, for the most part, the book reads like a list of complaints from the royal. To be frank (and somewhat fair) I am not a royal, nor did I live or have the lifestyle that he has or has dealt with). But what shocked me in reading the novel is the disregard that Harry and to an extent his publishing team showed, in how his words will sound to readers. In essence, as is somewhat hinted in the novel, for public figures (whether they be royals or actors) there is a contract of how their affairs are conducted and reported to the general masses. Yes, the British tabloids/paps are excessive, but its his cavalier ignorance (that his family and the palace, nor his friends could ever instill in him) that would have helped him avoid many of the situations that he describes. While there are moments that elicted a laugh, and also were cool to read because they paralled other historical events that I can remember as a child as well, overall I didn't really leave the memoir with any new feelings of sympathy for him - rather, just sorry in general that he felt that however/wherever he is in his life currently, that he felt the need to put out a book like this.

Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 stars - It's not particularly well-written but it's fascinating.Whomever wrote this book doesn't know what some words mean. It's incredibly frustrating. Either someone who received a top-class education (at which he admittedly did not succeed), someone who is hired to write books for people as a profession, or an actual editor fucked up and no one fixed it. Possibly more than one of these people had a vested or malicious interest in making Harry look like a bit of an idiot/For example, ""sometimes it was explicit and sometimes it was right in our faces"" and the (very common) misuse of ""nonplussed,"" which:adjective1.(of a person) surprised and confused so much that they are unsure how to react.I am not of the opinion that this book is out of line, that it's a play for drama, or that it's a grift. I don't think that Harry or Meghan are shitty people. Why SHOULDN'T he have an opportunity to make some money off of what's being said about him and his family?I do think that Harry was raised in a stifling, emotionally-neglectful environment where he was discouraged from expressing his grief, where his every move was hounded by paparazzi, where he couldn't form relationships or trust anyone not to screw him over. This book is very much about grief and being treated as a zoo animal whom people love to hate. So much of the press around this book has been so uncharitable and outright mean. If there is a SINGLE THING that convinces me that the machine of the Palace and what Harry says about it is true, it's the way that excerpts have been decontextualized and misquoted in whatever way makes him seem like a completely ridiculous asshole utterly lacking in self-awareness.His mom was killed when he was young, the men who hounded her to death photographed her dying moments rather than offering help, he essentially had no privacy and the same people who effectively killed his mother made bank off of lying about him (think about that for a second: an entire industry based off of making people believe shit about you that is untrue and insulting), and his own family ostensibly traded to those same people his vulnerabilities to protect their own. I'm surprised he's not doing worse.Also, to anyone who likes to deny that Meghan Markle experienced harassment and racism, you're delusional and could use an empathy quotient assessment. It's a shame this book has been shit on by so many people who may or may not have actually read it, or who are just mad that some monarchs won't like it. This could have been an excellent opportunity to discuss masculinity, the importance of communication (and therapy), the damage that can be done by grief, and the vile, invasive nature of the British press. Unfortunately, it's just ""Harry sings on the audiobook #cringe"" and ""he should stfu.""Him talking about his grandma's death made me cry.

Rating 4 out of 5,"*** 3.7 stars ***Well-written, compelling, strikingly intimate while equally ambiguous, this memoir was a page-turner indeed. Wildly scrutinized since birth for every cause, action, position, and scandal, he finally made the decision to “escape.” Now safely tucked away in America, Prince Harry sure knows how to spill the British tea! “Spare,” ghostwritten by J.R. Moehringer, who elevates the story with elegant metaphors, interwoven Shakespearean quotes, and occasional wit, divides Prince Harry’s life into three significant pieces: a wayward youth heavily impacted by his mother’s death, his military training and career, and his eventual relationship with Meghan Markle. Even as an American almost as far removed from those pesky, contentious headlines as Meghan first appeared to be, the narrative structure hooked me, made me insatiable for more. “Wait, what? What did he do next? What did he say? Oh, we will never know.”Presented in a chaotic order, yet still unbalanced, it felt like the tell-all we should’ve known was coming. Quite literally his life story but also rather broken, with short snippets that read more as excerpts than a full picture. Some stories *spared* no details while other chapters had things amiss, either deliberately or carelessly. It’s clear Moehringer masterfully crafted each chapter within the boundaries of intricacies he was allowed to work with. In his candid accounts, Prince Harry comes across sincere, though truth from exaggeration was hard to tell. Peppered with plenty of drama, he speaks as though he’s perpetually the victim. Nearly every conversation shows him astutely logical while his counterparts are madly irrational. His own mistakes are even described in a defensive tone. He admits retrospectively regretting the Nazi costume, for example, but also faults Prince William and Kate for suggesting he wear it rather than a British pilot’s uniform. Yet he doesn’t take the blame for picking the Nazi uniform as an option in the first place. Given his family history with Germany, you’d think he’d have arrived at better judgment sooner. Similarly, he blames the Vegas naked photos incident on those he couldn’t trust, even though there were people he’d never met present and playing a strip game was admittedly his idea. However, his obvious learning and unlearning is something to be lauded.I’m not sure if I should feel sympathy or consider this a much needed venting session, though I appreciated his acknowledgment of his own mental health issues. His hatred of journalists and paparazzi is deeply rooted and completely understandable, but his relationship with his family has such complexity - despite his love for them, he paints them in a negative light and I almost want to despise them too. His father and brother - do they ever genuinely care about him? Kate and Camilla - do we like or hate them, or are we indifferent? (I also found Meghan’s dialogue a little cringeworthy too - asking why curtsy to his grandmother, or why can’t he just leave his car stuck in traffic to walk to their secret restaurant meeting spot as a prince of England surely could do. How ignorantly American haha, but he thinks it’s cute.)Since the royal family stands by the motto, “Never complain, never explain,” Prince Harry’s perspective does them no favors. Netflix’s “The Crown” opened my eyes to how heavily the crown actually weighs on each member of the royal family. But this book challenges the notion that they stick up for each other via the monarchy. It highlights the pettiness and dysfunction, the vanity and competitiveness, the immobility and passivity running so toxic that I cannot bring myself to care. His family consistently abandons him and it’s pretty sad. Trapped in his position since birth, expected to carry out royal duties and obligations without question, fulfilling commitments decided upon with little say, and nearly everything he does triggering aggressive competition with family, it’s a wonder he didn��t flee England sooner. While it seems hypocritical (and equally petty) to publish a book on his side of the story, giving the press more fodder, this was probably very liberating for Prince Harry. A way for him to take back his narrative, share his version of events on his terms so that the media no longer has its everlasting stronghold on his public image. I wonder if this was never actually his idea but more of an exercise assigned him by his therapist to finally let it all out. But he sure did let it almost all out. If you’re into good memoirs, or happen to know a thing or two about the current British royal family, you might find this an interesting read.

Rating 5 out of 5,"I don't know how to review this really. I can't even say why I read it. I don't follow the Royals and don't really care all the much, other than to be glad we don't live under a monarchy in the U.S. And yet, I couldn't resist this book. In fairness to myself, I do like the occasional memoir. So what did I like and dislike? Let me acknowledge that I've been told he had a ghost-writer or at least some sort of help. Given how poorly he did in school, according to him, I wouldn't be surprised and don't ""take off points"" for getting needed help. The book is quite well written.The book is filled with descriptions of what it is like to be hounded by the paps. Hell, his life, to date, has been filled with such hounding, so any remotely honest memoir would have to include this. More than including it, however, the book gives readers a visceral sense of what it is to live this reality. How the rest of his family can shrug it off is beyond me. Oh, wait, we learn that they have ""people"" who (officially or otherwise) deal with the press, to the point of planting stories. This family is VERY manipulative and will not tolerate being upstaged. All of this was heart-wrenching, especially the attacks on Meghan, to point of pushing her to the brink of suicide.You should know that I'm a staunchly anti-war pacifist, so dreaded reading about Harry's war experiences. That said, this part of the book actually was enlightening, to be able to read about these experiences from the point of view of a veteran. Here in the US veterans often do not discuss this at all with those of us who are not veterans. From my experience, this is even true of vets in the peace movement (though some of these will talk about their PTSD to civilian activists). Of interest were: Harry's love of finally being good at something, of being able to be a leader; his love of flying his plane; his frustration with the military bureaucracy, which got in the way of being able to do the job he was there to do; his bonds with veterans; and, finally, of Harry's long-term inability to see, much less seek help for, his own PTSD, even while working with veterans' groups, working to help veterans. All of this, mind you, while being stalked and chased by paps.The Royal Family members, except for his grandmother, were vicious toward Harry and Meghan, with a large dollop of racism in the mix. What horrible human beings!This is a sad story, filled with the destruction of family relationships by both the paps and the unquestioned stance of putting the monarchy above all else. One criticism is that Harry really doesn't see to fully grasp his privilege. Despite the hardships that he experienced, beginning with his mother's death, he had quite a cushion and a lot that very few will ever experience. Can't speak for you, but going to Botswana for a school break and frequently after that was never in my cards. Not that he has written a ""poor little rich boy"" sort of book. Far from it. He just seems to be very attuned to some issues, but not all.To end on a happy note, let me tell you that Harry and Meghan's love story--and this truly is a love story--is beautiful, despite all they went through.

Rating 4 out of 5,"I don't know if I have anything to say about this book that hasn't already been said, but I'm putting my thoughts here for my own benefit.It surprised me that this book wasn't a bombshell or a monarchy-destroying vengeance, etc. but rather a haunted and personal account of things as Harry remembers them. The tone of this book also surprised me, it seemed caged, and less direct than I had been expecting. The British press, the clear villain of this book, blew things a bit out of proportion.The book is split into three parts which are comprised of many short chapters each recalling a specific memory or feeling. The first part is about the death of Princess Diana and Harry's experiences grappling with, or rather, not grappling with her death as he grew into adulthood. Part two is mainly about his adulthood before meeting Meghan, mainly comprised of his time preparing for, and being deployed to Afghanistan during the War on Terror. The third part is about his life with Meghan and what they have built together and faced together.For many, the first part of the book is the favorite, the middle part is boring, and the final part is made lovely by his love for Meghan. In general, I would agree, however, I don't want people to skip over the part where Harry discusses his military career. It was deeply uncomfortable for me, a woman in a family of veterans, to hear another account of someone looking for purpose after a difficult childhood and ending up in the military. He was given a purpose and a distraction, but it didn't offer him much but a putting-off of the difficult realities that he didn't want to face. I think that his experience as a soldier makes it more difficult for him to face his own mistakes, and makes him unable to face criticism with an open heart.I also really feel for him where it comes to his family being so cold and competitive. Being able to count the number of hugs you have given your Granny (0) is completely insane to me. When Harry is unable to say that his family is racist, instead opting for ""unconsciously biased"" or when he offers them passes for not yet grappling with their hand in colonization, I just remember that this is a person who has never been touched, of course he's going to be a weirdo and blind to a lot of his and his family's issues.The way his love for Meghan is described is really lovely. To me, this is the compelling part of the story. I think they are both a bit naïve and even in over their heads, but I find myself rooting for them all the same. In general, I find it a little silly to be asked to listen to a prince, to sympathize with him, when his experience has been so materially different from my own. I can recognize that Harry has been through a lot, and I wish him and his young family peace.Show more",4,I dont know if I have anything to say about this book that hasnt already been said but Im putting my thoughts here for my own benefitIt surprised me that this book wasnt a bombshell or a monarchydestroying vengeance etc but rather a haunted and personal account of things as Harry remembers them The tone of this book also surprised me it seemed caged and less direct than I had been expecting The British press the clear villain of this book blew things a bit out of proportionThe book is split into three parts which are comprised of many short chapters each recalling a specific memory or feeling The first part is about the death of Princess Diana and Harrys experiences grappling with or rather not grappling with her death as he grew into adulthood Part two is mainly about his adulthood before meeting Meghan mainly comprised of his time preparing for and being deployed to Afghanistan during the War on Terror The third part is about his life with Meghan and what they have built together and faced togetherFor many the first part of the book is the favorite the middle part is boring and the final part is made lovely by his love for Meghan In general I would agree however I dont want people to skip over the part where Harry discusses his military career It was deeply uncomfortable for me a woman in a family of veterans to hear another account of someone looking for purpose after a difficult childhood and ending up in the military He was given a purpose and a distraction but it didnt offer him much but a puttingoff of the difficult realities that he didnt want to face I think that his experience as a soldier makes it more difficult for him to face his own mistakes and makes him unable to face criticism with an open heartI also really feel for him where it comes to his family being so cold and competitive Being able to count the number of hugs you have given your Granny 0 is completely insane to me When Harry is unable to say that his family is racist instead opting for unconsciously biased or when he offers them passes for not yet grappling with their hand in colonization I just remember that this is a person who has never been touched of course hes going to be a weirdo and blind to a lot of his and his familys issuesThe way his love for Meghan is described is really lovely To me this is the compelling part of the story I think they are both a bit naïve and even in over their heads but I find myself rooting for them all the same In general I find it a little silly to be asked to listen to a prince to sympathize with him when his experience has been so materially different from my own I can recognize that Harry has been through a lot and I wish him and his young family peaceShow more
Rating 3 out of 5,"Note to readers of biographical reviews. Skip the one star reviews. Skip the five star reviews. Those are going to be about people's feelings about the subject matter. Perhaps you think Harry is a disloyal bastard who betrayed his country. Maybe you think he is a persecuted saint who had the courage to speak up against forces of old and evil.But truthfully, this book is not either of these things. I always liked Harry. He was wild and rebellious as a kid which I enjoyed. He was an advocate for mental health which I respected and admired. I decided to give this book a chance.This book? Deeply insightful in places. Rambling in spots. Wildly self-indulgent in others. It is after all a 37-year old writing a memoir. And I suppose by writing it, he gave the people what they wanted. The dirt. The inside scoop. A firsthand look at how the sausage gets made. While watching ""The Crown"" I was always struck by one thing about Queen Elizabeth (also a ""spare"" once upon a time.) She was in wildly over her head as a young woman, but somehow managed to navigate nearly every difficult situation that was thrown at her with dignity, class, and grace under pressure. Yes, I know the show is fiction, but one only has to look at her life to understand she possesses these traits in spades. Harry? Not so much. And that is NOT to say there isn't an argument to be made for him speaking out. Perhaps the days of Kings and Queens have passed. The ""machine"" destroyed his mother after all, and with each passing year, more and more people seem to be losing interest in the financially punitive show that is the monarchy. Harry very well may have started hammering one of the final nails in the coffin. Maybe it needed burning down.But is he a hero? Not the way I read the story. He married a fragile narcissist whose influence over him is significant. For someone who professed that privacy was his aim, he's made sure he's in the news nearly every single day. This certainly seems to be influenced by his choice of partner. He wouldn't be the first or last man to be a fool for love, and again, it's a 37-year old writing a memoir. it's very hard for me to see a happy ending here for him. But does this whole thing work as a book? Sometimes. When he's able to be vulnerable, it's an interesting read. When he wanders into self-pity, jealousy, and spite, these things are pretty apparent as well. As with any book, you ask, ""what was the purpose of writing this? What feelings was the author trying to evoke in his audience?"" I wanted the answer to be about vulnerability. But in the end, it seems the purpose was at least in part to punish those who had wronged him and of course make money.it's not a motive I can get behind. I think there is a much better man inside of Harry. Perhaps the road of excess will eventually lead to the palace of wisdom for him.But he's not quite there yet.Show more",3,Note to readers of biographical reviews Skip the one star reviews Skip the five star reviews Those are going to be about peoples feelings about the subject matter Perhaps you think Harry is a disloyal bastard who betrayed his country Maybe you think he is a persecuted saint who had the courage to speak up against forces of old and evilBut truthfully this book is not either of these things I always liked Harry He was wild and rebellious as a kid which I enjoyed He was an advocate for mental health which I respected and admired I decided to give this book a chanceThis book Deeply insightful in places Rambling in spots Wildly selfindulgent in others It is after all a 37year old writing a memoir And I suppose by writing it he gave the people what they wanted The dirt The inside scoop A firsthand look at how the sausage gets made While watching The Crown I was always struck by one thing about Queen Elizabeth also a spare once upon a time She was in wildly over her head as a young woman but somehow managed to navigate nearly every difficult situation that was thrown at her with dignity class and grace under pressure Yes I know the show is fiction but one only has to look at her life to understand she possesses these traits in spades Harry Not so much And that is NOT to say there isnt an argument to be made for him speaking out Perhaps the days of Kings and Queens have passed The machine destroyed his mother after all and with each passing year more and more people seem to be losing interest in the financially punitive show that is the monarchy Harry very well may have started hammering one of the final nails in the coffin Maybe it needed burning downBut is he a hero Not the way I read the story He married a fragile narcissist whose influence over him is significant For someone who professed that privacy was his aim hes made sure hes in the news nearly every single day This certainly seems to be influenced by his choice of partner He wouldnt be the first or last man to be a fool for love and again its a 37year old writing a memoir its very hard for me to see a happy ending here for him But does this whole thing work as a book Sometimes When hes able to be vulnerable its an interesting read When he wanders into selfpity jealousy and spite these things are pretty apparent as well As with any book you ask what was the purpose of writing this What feelings was the author trying to evoke in his audience I wanted the answer to be about vulnerability But in the end it seems the purpose was at least in part to punish those who had wronged him and of course make moneyits not a motive I can get behind I think there is a much better man inside of Harry Perhaps the road of excess will eventually lead to the palace of wisdom for himBut hes not quite there yetShow more
Rating 5 out of 5,"I have always been fascinated with the royal family—and not only the current occupants of Buckingham Palace, but also all the way back to the War of the Roses. So of course, I had to read this book, one of the first to really dish about what goes on inside those very private, guarded rooms behind the famous public balcony overlooking The Mall.The book is titled ""Spare,"" since Prince Charles reportedly said to Princess Diana after Harry's birth: ""Wonderful! You have given me an heir and a spare—my work is done."" The writing is also ""spare"" with short sentences, short paragraphs, short chapters. It has a staccato pacing and tone. Quick. To the point. Let's keep moving. It's almost as if Prince Harry can't wait to tell us his story. And for us to read it. (It's a long book but a very fast read.) He doesn't linger. Gets to the point. This tale is one that is told from the heart. While the first two-thirds of the book are about Prince Harry's childhood, the challenging and trying years following his mother's untimely death, his academic difficulties, and his time serving in the British Army, he would never have violated the oldest and most sacrosanct of palace protocols—never tell—if it weren't for the final third of the book. That is all about Meghan—meeting her, dating her, loving her, marrying her. She truly is the answer to all his dreams and hopes for his life. But the combination of the vitriol, hatred, lies, and racism spewed constantly by the British tabloid press along with the vitriol, hatred, lies, and racism of his own family toward the woman he loves was something he valiantly tried to battle but, in the end, couldn't. He was caught in an infuriating and exasperating middle. The tabloids repeatedly made up ridiculous and blatantly false stories to sell papers, but the palace wouldn't allow Harry to refute or correct them. In addition, his own family seemingly had it in for Meghan and their marriage. Prince Harry was being beaten up on all sides and was never allowed to fight back. Ah, but the pen is mightier than the sword! It is through this book that Prince Harry (along with the ghostwriter J.R. Moehringer) tells his side of the story, and he makes it clear in the prologue that this is the reason he wrote the book. Even if the book is biased toward Harry's point of view, it's hard to imagine it's not more filled with truth than falsities. ""Spare"" is a scathing and eye-opening look at what it means to be a modern-day royal, besieged without relief by the tabloid press, no personal freedom to do anything without permission from the monarch, and being bound by age-old traditions that stifle and smother. That is what makes this book a powder keg for the British monarchy as many of its secrets that range from merely surprising to outright shocking are openly exposed. It took courage to write this book, as it has the potential to forever sever Prince Harry from his family.Show more",5,I have always been fascinated with the royal familyand not only the current occupants of Buckingham Palace but also all the way back to the War of the Roses So of course I had to read this book one of the first to really dish about what goes on inside those very private guarded rooms behind the famous public balcony overlooking The MallThe book is titled Spare since Prince Charles reportedly said to Princess Diana after Harrys birth Wonderful You have given me an heir and a sparemy work is done The writing is also spare with short sentences short paragraphs short chapters It has a staccato pacing and tone Quick To the point Lets keep moving Its almost as if Prince Harry cant wait to tell us his story And for us to read it Its a long book but a very fast read He doesnt linger Gets to the point This tale is one that is told from the heart While the first twothirds of the book are about Prince Harrys childhood the challenging and trying years following his mothers untimely death his academic difficulties and his time serving in the British Army he would never have violated the oldest and most sacrosanct of palace protocolsnever tellif it werent for the final third of the book That is all about Meghanmeeting her dating her loving her marrying her She truly is the answer to all his dreams and hopes for his life But the combination of the vitriol hatred lies and racism spewed constantly by the British tabloid press along with the vitriol hatred lies and racism of his own family toward the woman he loves was something he valiantly tried to battle but in the end couldnt He was caught in an infuriating and exasperating middle The tabloids repeatedly made up ridiculous and blatantly false stories to sell papers but the palace wouldnt allow Harry to refute or correct them In addition his own family seemingly had it in for Meghan and their marriage Prince Harry was being beaten up on all sides and was never allowed to fight back Ah but the pen is mightier than the sword It is through this book that Prince Harry along with the ghostwriter JR Moehringer tells his side of the story and he makes it clear in the prologue that this is the reason he wrote the book Even if the book is biased toward Harrys point of view its hard to imagine its not more filled with truth than falsities Spare is a scathing and eyeopening look at what it means to be a modernday royal besieged without relief by the tabloid press no personal freedom to do anything without permission from the monarch and being bound by ageold traditions that stifle and smother That is what makes this book a powder keg for the British monarchy as many of its secrets that range from merely surprising to outright shocking are openly exposed It took courage to write this book as it has the potential to forever sever Prince Harry from his familyShow more
Rating 4 out of 5,"Great listen. I fully recommend listening on Audible. If you have already decided Harry and Meghan are awful people (why?), they I guess you shouldn’t read this bc it won’t change your mind. If, like me, you like both of Diana’s sons and what they have put out into the world, then give this a try. It will open your mind to the fact he is a human. Just like any one of us. Not sure when we became so toxic as a society as to judge him for having a messed up family and having dragged their personal stories out to share his thoughts and feeling and version. He and Meghan have done nothing to hurt you- give this a listen and understand the history of a damaged child losing his mother in the most awful public way possible. And open your mind to what he has to say. For that matter, it opened my mind to what William and Kate live through and it makes me feel so sympathetic to them as well. If you think of it as a regular autobiography, I have to say it is very well written as far as language and prose goes. A lot of them aren’t!. My biggest issue is that 1) by deciding to write this and share his version of the stories written about him, he has exposed himself forever. And that’s hard. It makes me feel sad for him and that he has most likely ruined the relationship with his family members forever. Bc he does tell his version of events and their words. Who know what exactly happened from a neutral perspective.? This is always true when you lay it all out there FROM your view only. Sad. But his family is not the first to have a feud. It happens in most families I know. And certainly relationships are often broken when autobiographies are written. Again, a sad result. I am not sure why 2). Fact checking. He didn’t seem to do it! When a more journalistic view of an autobiography is taken, I feel that people have researchers back up data. I don’t think they did that and I found that lazy. He contradicts on a few occasions and says hey that’s how I remember it, maybe didn’t happen that exact way. Hm. But you do get the important thing which is who he is and how sad his life and frankly the entire lives of the royal family are. So so sad. I came out of this thinking I felt so sad for them and William and Kate. And feeling like the monarchy should be eradicated . And most of all I worry that the cult of personality and how toxic the media is is the saddest stAtement of all. There is nothing redeeming about the way we let paparazzi control society. This is truly messed up. I just re read this as I type on my phone really quickly and realized how many times I said “sad”. Yup, that’s right. But the background story and what he wants to share is still so interesting. Considering the gag order he’s lived under his whole life, I’m not surprised it came tumbling out. Best of luck to him and all parts of his family.

🟥🅾Okay, I am excited.And because I am speck of dust in this universe, my words shouldn't hurt you.🤔
Why do I read biographies?
❎I read them only because I want to know about the struggles of that person, I want to just know what kind of world he/she grew up in. ❎I never read a biography to know what a person is like in real life, you can never truly know someone unless you birth them, birth by them or marry them. And even that's not enough sometimes.❎I read biographies of only those people who are wayyyyyy out of my world. People who aren't Indian or people who are great legendary movie stars.❎Because it kinda makes me feel exciting to know what that limelight world is like, and how the person I am reading about managed to survive and overcome difficulties , but also became the best at what he/she does.❎Also, some biographies are quirky and sort of like.... Open books yk? No hard grammar no need to concentrate much or worry about where did I leave it last time? Or no need to follow a certain plot, its a free read.🅾
A MESSAGE TO .... you know who you are-
❎People giving this 1 ⭐...... WOW! just..... pat yourselves on the back. You did it! You managed to dethrone someone who was already dethroned. ❎People have been saying, ""Don't buy this book, he is betrayer, this book will make him more money.""❎Guys, do you personally know him? Did he offend women? Involved in terrorist organizations? Involved in practices that might lead to social, economical, physical harm to people of his country?❎WE DO NOT KNOW WHY HE MARRIED MEGAN. It could be love, it could be something else, I don't know and I DON'T CARE. ❎It's NOT about me. We don't know the reason what he did, does, will do. Politics is not about what I believe and you believe. Everything is conspiracy theory until the results arrive.❎We don't know ANYTHING about what goes on in his life. We only know what is shown to us. This is true for the whole Social Media.❎I don't want you to buy the book. I mean c'mon, and Indian requesting you to buy a book of your own Prince? ❎Don't buy the book if you don't want to.❎Just stop rating it without even reading. ❎Also, I've never understood why people give less than 4 stars to biographies, what? Did he/she not live his life in a way that you expected to? ❎Dude, read it as a stranger telling you their story in a long bus ride. JUST LISTEN.❎Don't be a judgmental prick.😎Namaste. 🙏🔺

🟥✅When I was in 6th grade , I refused to read MK Gandhi's biography, because it was like , ""He did this. then he went there. Then he fought him. Then he studies there.""✅It was essay-like.✅But I really like how modern biographies are written in form of a story. Its like reading ""The catcher in the rye."" ✅You never get bored now when you read biographies. And I really like that they have open narrative.... very loose and friendly, not.... strict and disciplinary.✅Its the same with this book.

Rating 4 out of 5,"I originally didn't want to read this book out of respect for the Royal Family, however I saw a clip of one of the interviews where Harry said for years we had been drip fed an alternative reality from the Palace itself from 'Royal Sources' so he just wanted to get his view across. Whatever your opinion is on the royal family and Harry and Meghan I beg of you to read this. It is brutally honest, reflective and very sad. Not only did the Paparazzi take his mother away, his mental health, his freedom and his counrry it nearly cost him family. I am shocked that when they had to flee their security had been taken away when their address had been published. I don't understand how any father or brother can let that happen let alone be the ones associated with those responsible for helping plant the false stories. It is clear the love Harrry has for his country and his family, the most of the hatred is at the paparazzi and those who feed them. Yes there are some uncomfortable parts for Charles, William, Kate and Camilla but I bet he could have revealed a lot worse with only hinting at Camillas medelling and partoniship with the press. The fact they deliberately planted false stories when he was merely a child grieving for his mother to help shine Charles and Camilla in a positive light is truly sickening. Charles comes across quiet well and its clear William has some own issues he needs to deal with. After decades of being protrayed wrongle and used as a pawn I'm surprised it took Harry this long to share his story. Harry lost so much at such a young age including is mother and his best friend yet had to pretend he was fine and had absolutely no support to help process his trauma. I am ashamed at Britain for believing the blatant lies and encouraging the racism aimed at Meghan. Also it is not until about 2/3 of the way through is Meghan introduced there is so much before which he had to endure and was fed like a pig to slaughter multiple times. The only criticism is the level of detail which in some cases may not have been required to the reader like all the drug use but I admire his honesty. I applaud Harry for speaking out and hope this helps to silence the papers, haters and glad he is happy.This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review",4,I originally didnt want to read this book out of respect for the Royal Family however I saw a clip of one of the interviews where Harry said for years we had been drip fed an alternative reality from the Palace itself from Royal Sources so he just wanted to get his view across Whatever your opinion is on the royal family and Harry and Meghan I beg of you to read this It is brutally honest reflective and very sad Not only did the Paparazzi take his mother away his mental health his freedom and his counrry it nearly cost him family I am shocked that when they had to flee their security had been taken away when their address had been published I dont understand how any father or brother can let that happen let alone be the ones associated with those responsible for helping plant the false stories It is clear the love Harrry has for his country and his family the most of the hatred is at the paparazzi and those who feed them Yes there are some uncomfortable parts for Charles William Kate and Camilla but I bet he could have revealed a lot worse with only hinting at Camillas medelling and partoniship with the press The fact they deliberately planted false stories when he was merely a child grieving for his mother to help shine Charles and Camilla in a positive light is truly sickening Charles comes across quiet well and its clear William has some own issues he needs to deal with After decades of being protrayed wrongle and used as a pawn Im surprised it took Harry this long to share his story Harry lost so much at such a young age including is mother and his best friend yet had to pretend he was fine and had absolutely no support to help process his trauma I am ashamed at Britain for believing the blatant lies and encouraging the racism aimed at Meghan Also it is not until about 23 of the way through is Meghan introduced there is so much before which he had to endure and was fed like a pig to slaughter multiple times The only criticism is the level of detail which in some cases may not have been required to the reader like all the drug use but I admire his honesty I applaud Harry for speaking out and hope this helps to silence the papers haters and glad he is happyThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilersShow full review
Rating 1 out of 5,"Ok, I caved in and I read this whole thing and… Well, it’s not good. If you’re looking for entertainment, I’m afraid the most exciting parts involve either a prince dressed as a chicken running away as his friends shoot fireworks at him, or said prince shooting cactus from a helicopter. If it’s literature you’re looking for, you will be treated with literary gems such as:“The day I got my wings, I figured she got hers.”That’s when he breaks up with a girlfriend on the same day he got his colonel-in-chief wings. Poetic.“I regaled the company with tales of the North Pole. Pa was very interested, and sympathetic about the discomfort of my frostnipped ears and cheeks, and it was an effort not to overshare and tell him also about my equally tender penis.”Well, the less said about that, the better.This book is also an ode to ignorance. Harry seems to be proud of his. “At all costs, I avoided sitting quietly with a book”, he writes on his best-seller. “It wasn’t just that I didn’t know anything about my family’s history: I didn’t want to know anything.” Ok. He also tells us he lived near Stratford-upon-Avon and his father took him there a lot to see Shakespeare plays, which our Duke found “torture”. He also tried to read ""Hamlet"" once, apparently, but “slammed it shut. No, thank you.” This is all a bit odd because he makes quite a lot of references to Shakespeare throughout the book, comparing himself to Henry IV and his father to Henry V. It’s almost like he didn’t write this.But the main feeling I got after reading this was that it was nothing more than a well-paid therapy exercise. Therapy is all about deconstructing your life and your relations in order to build something new, but it seems Harry has forgotten about the second part. He seems intent on destroying everything and everyone in his life. Every little slight anybody is ever done to him is amplified and you find yourself reading about lip-gloss sharing, bridesmaids’ dresses tailoring and abusive parking as if they’re human rights violations.I also got the impression that Harry is a very privileged and damaged individual. The book is moving at parts and you can’t help but feel sorry for Harry. It’s impossible to imagine what it feels like to be 12 years-old and walking behind your mother’s coffin as millions of people watch. But there have to be better ways of dealing with it than writing a book this spiteful about people who, by his own account, were trying to help him.Show more",1,Ok I caved in and I read this whole thing and Well its not good If youre looking for entertainment Im afraid the most exciting parts involve either a prince dressed as a chicken running away as his friends shoot fireworks at him or said prince shooting cactus from a helicopter If its literature youre looking for you will be treated with literary gems such asThe day I got my wings I figured she got hersThats when he breaks up with a girlfriend on the same day he got his colonelinchief wings PoeticI regaled the company with tales of the North Pole Pa was very interested and sympathetic about the discomfort of my frostnipped ears and cheeks and it was an effort not to overshare and tell him also about my equally tender penisWell the less said about that the betterThis book is also an ode to ignorance Harry seems to be proud of his At all costs I avoided sitting quietly with a book he writes on his bestseller It wasnt just that I didnt know anything about my familys history I didnt want to know anything Ok He also tells us he lived near StratforduponAvon and his father took him there a lot to see Shakespeare plays which our Duke found torture He also tried to read Hamlet once apparently but slammed it shut No thank you This is all a bit odd because he makes quite a lot of references to Shakespeare throughout the book comparing himself to Henry IV and his father to Henry V Its almost like he didnt write thisBut the main feeling I got after reading this was that it was nothing more than a wellpaid therapy exercise Therapy is all about deconstructing your life and your relations in order to build something new but it seems Harry has forgotten about the second part He seems intent on destroying everything and everyone in his life Every little slight anybody is ever done to him is amplified and you find yourself reading about lipgloss sharing bridesmaids dresses tailoring and abusive parking as if theyre human rights violationsI also got the impression that Harry is a very privileged and damaged individual The book is moving at parts and you cant help but feel sorry for Harry Its impossible to imagine what it feels like to be 12 yearsold and walking behind your mothers coffin as millions of people watch But there have to be better ways of dealing with it than writing a book this spiteful about people who by his own account were trying to help himShow more
Rating 5 out of 5,"What can I say about the Spare? Well, I’m going to start off with I wanted to read the book, like most people out there because I was curious. After the doci on Netflix Harry & Megan, I still had unanswered questions. I was hoping this book would answer them. And listen, it did.Before I start going down this rabbit hole, I want to remind you and I kept on reminding myself that biography is told out of his or her view. If you tell a story about something that happened you are telling it from your perspective and your mom, dad, friends even siblings will remember it maybe differently, but you are telling it how you remembered it and felt. I think having that mind set helped me enjoy this book a bit more.I’m going to state the obvious, I am a royal lover and I do love any royals. So I am also team William and Kate. But that said I get where Harry is coming from. I get why he wrote this book and did the documentary.Spoiler alertI felt Harry does take things a bit more personally. Like when William told him when they started going to the same school you don’t know me so don’t greet me ext I get that. I never mingled with my younger brother at school either. Or when William said he can’t spend the night because of the kids. Well being a parent you don’t want to spend the night away from the little ones. In the same breath, Harry did the same. But there is a double standard too. And like Harry pointed out that when the press published something about Megan he wanted them to retract or even sue, but the other family members in the family meeting (yes they have family meetings) said no. When he pointed out that the Queen had sued, Charles sued them over leaked working documents, and William sued over topless photos of Kate, they could not answer. They said it's not the same, said let it go.How Harry was sort off ambushed in the Summit. And although he had an option of 5 the choice was already chosen.

Rating 3 out of 5,"The stories Harry tells about his childhood and adult life as a senior Royal in the British monarchy are fascinating and you can't get enough. Why? Why are people (myself included) so interested in the rich and famous' lives? Why is Reality TV so popular? Whatever the reason, the media has learned to capitalize on this by productizing people's lives. Build them up (weddings and babies get the most clicks!), then tear them down (family funds and controversies get more!). Harry decides enough is enough as he decides to tell his side of the story, for both the public, but also for his family, especially his father and brother by whom he clearly feels betrayed and abandoned.My issues with the book: 1) The writing is pretty cheesy at times, constant heavy use of a lot of kind of silly adjectives to describe the press and paparazzi that ends up sounding pretty childish. I mean I get it, you hate them, but the writing can be a little silly.2) I struggle with the concept of writing an autobiography and telling your story with all of your insight, and everyone has the right to do that. But ""my rights end where yours begin,"" and he definitely goes into detail about other people's stories, things that they may not want (definitely do not want!) told to the public. I can't see how Harry will reconcile with his family after this. That may not be what he wants, however, he may just want to tell his truth, blow everything up, and go on with his life. 3) It's probably important to note that there are multiple sides to every story, and the truth lies somewhere in the middle. I'm sure his family members have their sides, and this book does paint Harry in the sympathetic light, and he is always kind of ""Aw shucks guys,"" or ""I guess I did do (drunken stupid 20 year old boy thing) after my mate took me there and I followed along"" etc. 4) It can be hard to sympathize with the very rich and privileged at times, and their perception of problems can be relative, but I cannot imagine living in a fishbowl to that extent and being chased constantly by paparazzi. But there were times that I did feel that they were focusing too much on the news, reading every story and comment, and that will drive anyone crazy.

Rating 3 out of 5,"I am an avid participant in Royal Family gossip, so when Prince Harry announced that he was releasing a memoir, I signed up for the pre-order without a second thought (I don’t even think I checked my bank account to make sure I could buy it!). Beyond loving Royal Family gossip, I also have loved Megan and Harry as a couple since it was announced to the world that they were dating in 2016. Another no brainer as to why I wanted to read this book. As days kept passing closer to the release date, more and more anecdotes that Harry confessed were leaking out and I didn’t know what to make of it. Everything the press put out made me look twice because it was never something I’d hear someone from the British Monarchy talk about. Rolling joints, eating shrooms and ayahuasca for spiritual and medicinal purposes…who is this man and why does he look like Prince Harry?And then it finally released and I was able to get my hands dirty, dive right in. Beyond the Preface and Epilogue, the book is structured chronologically throughout Harry’s life. He doesn’t shy away from how it felt growing up in a family where it was clear that his parents despised each other or how he felt he was always expected to remain in the shadow of his brother, William, Prince of Wales (whom he apparently refers to as “Willy”). What I do appreciate most about it all is how me managed to expose the corruption of The Monarchy and the British press while also conveying the deep love he has for his family and his country. Throughout the book, Harry finds away to be frank and vulnerable about his dynamic with his family and within himself. While I definitely didn’t expect or want to learn some of the things I learned (SPOILER ALERT: during a trip to the North Pole, Harry ended up getting frostbite on his nether regions), this openness is so admired and appreciated. It’s brave. Spare is the latest in a line of courageous acts from the Second Son of England. Will this book be for everyone, no. But I don’t think it’s meant for everyone. This was his story to tell. And he did it. He left no stone unturned. There is no doubt about that.This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review",3,I am an avid participant in Royal Family gossip so when Prince Harry announced that he was releasing a memoir I signed up for the preorder without a second thought I dont even think I checked my bank account to make sure I could buy it Beyond loving Royal Family gossip I also have loved Megan and Harry as a couple since it was announced to the world that they were dating in 2016 Another no brainer as to why I wanted to read this book As days kept passing closer to the release date more and more anecdotes that Harry confessed were leaking out and I didnt know what to make of it Everything the press put out made me look twice because it was never something Id hear someone from the British Monarchy talk about Rolling joints eating shrooms and ayahuasca for spiritual and medicinal purposeswho is this man and why does he look like Prince HarryAnd then it finally released and I was able to get my hands dirty dive right in Beyond the Preface and Epilogue the book is structured chronologically throughout Harrys life He doesnt shy away from how it felt growing up in a family where it was clear that his parents despised each other or how he felt he was always expected to remain in the shadow of his brother William Prince of Wales whom he apparently refers to as Willy What I do appreciate most about it all is how me managed to expose the corruption of The Monarchy and the British press while also conveying the deep love he has for his family and his country Throughout the book Harry finds away to be frank and vulnerable about his dynamic with his family and within himself While I definitely didnt expect or want to learn some of the things I learned SPOILER ALERT during a trip to the North Pole Harry ended up getting frostbite on his nether regions this openness is so admired and appreciated Its brave Spare is the latest in a line of courageous acts from the Second Son of England Will this book be for everyone no But I dont think its meant for everyone This was his story to tell And he did it He left no stone unturned There is no doubt about thatThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilersShow full review
Rating 5 out of 5,"Woowee did this surpass my expectations!! This was a 5 ⭐️ read experience for me in particular for a few reasons so here's my deep dive.1. i just spent 2 months in London so am very fixated on many things royal. Note that it's true a lot of people their do not like Meghan and definitely have a ""suck it up"" mentality2. I love memoirs read by the author and haha the British accent does it for me (mummy + willy!) note that there are LOTS of chapters and he's slow so definitely 1.1x if not faster.3. Lack of choice -- I think one thing people really forget when thinking about the royals is the lack of choice they have. Even Queen Elizabeth story I find slightly sad overall. With US/Hollywood celebrities there is some choice of how visible to be in the public eye (and someone like Billie Eilish say) can maintain a *relatively* private life w minor scandals here and there. Also the gift that no one is THAT famous in the US. For Harry, since birth he's been born *with* the spotlight on him but *minuscule* chances of that spotlight serving its purpose of becoming monarch. This lack of choice bleeds into all areas of his life, with girls dumping him because of the spotlight and his youthful mistakes being aired publically.4. The British press just being horrendous (and all of us playing into this celebrity culture). Even if someone wants to be famous they don't want to be STALKED and I think that nuance is soooo often lost.5. The trauma of the death of his mother. Diana didn't die of a disease or a freak accident, she was frankly murdered by the paparazzi. This trauma really impacts Harry deeply in the entire book, while it seems his brother was able to heal/cope by the time he was a young adult. I don't think until I read the book I fully grasped what kind of impact his mother dying when he was 12 years old due to a whole industry that continued to ruin his own life could have on someone's psyche.6. Finally, King Charles is an a**hole. I think this was pretty common knowledge during the Diana years but I always wanted to give him a chance. Hearing the relationship in this book and seeing him as King now just feels so meh compared to the queen. The lack of love from parent <-> child is a bit shocking coming from a secure parental attachment.Finally, one of the reasons I did enjoy this book so much is how candid Harry is. He admits to a bunch of stupid things done in his youth, while also revealing the dark underbelly of parts of his family. Is there still a positive Harry tilt to it? Sure! But most celebrity memoirs (eg Obamas) you can tell they are keeping some things very close to the chest. This is probably good for their own mental health but as a reader I want as much of the juice as possible!!!!!!I will say I do not necessarily believe this book is necessary a net positive for Harry himself. My parents definitely encouraged a bit of ""trauma stays within the family"" mindset. Airing his family's dirty laundry so publicly may in fact be the final blow to their relationship(s) and that's something he'll have to live with. But if you are interested in the royals overall and enjoy some good gossip/drama/tea, I think you'll really enjoy this book!Show more",5,Woowee did this surpass my expectations This was a 5  read experience for me in particular for a few reasons so heres my deep dive1 i just spent 2 months in London so am very fixated on many things royal Note that its true a lot of people their do not like Meghan and definitely have a suck it up mentality2 I love memoirs read by the author and haha the British accent does it for me mummy  willy note that there are LOTS of chapters and hes slow so definitely 11x if not faster3 Lack of choice  I think one thing people really forget when thinking about the royals is the lack of choice they have Even Queen Elizabeth story I find slightly sad overall With USHollywood celebrities there is some choice of how visible to be in the public eye and someone like Billie Eilish say can maintain a relatively private life w minor scandals here and there Also the gift that no one is THAT famous in the US For Harry since birth hes been born with the spotlight on him but minuscule chances of that spotlight serving its purpose of becoming monarch This lack of choice bleeds into all areas of his life with girls dumping him because of the spotlight and his youthful mistakes being aired publically4 The British press just being horrendous and all of us playing into this celebrity culture Even if someone wants to be famous they dont want to be STALKED and I think that nuance is soooo often lost5 The trauma of the death of his mother Diana didnt die of a disease or a freak accident she was frankly murdered by the paparazzi This trauma really impacts Harry deeply in the entire book while it seems his brother was able to healcope by the time he was a young adult I dont think until I read the book I fully grasped what kind of impact his mother dying when he was 12 years old due to a whole industry that continued to ruin his own life could have on someones psyche6 Finally King Charles is an ahole I think this was pretty common knowledge during the Diana years but I always wanted to give him a chance Hearing the relationship in this book and seeing him as King now just feels so meh compared to the queen The lack of love from parent  child is a bit shocking coming from a secure parental attachmentFinally one of the reasons I did enjoy this book so much is how candid Harry is He admits to a bunch of stupid things done in his youth while also revealing the dark underbelly of parts of his family Is there still a positive Harry tilt to it Sure But most celebrity memoirs eg Obamas you can tell they are keeping some things very close to the chest This is probably good for their own mental health but as a reader I want as much of the juice as possibleI will say I do not necessarily believe this book is necessary a net positive for Harry himself My parents definitely encouraged a bit of trauma stays within the family mindset Airing his familys dirty laundry so publicly may in fact be the final blow to their relationships and thats something hell have to live with But if you are interested in the royals overall and enjoy some good gossipdramatea I think youll really enjoy this bookShow more
Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 stars! I find myself quite defensive of Prince Harry lately and I really enjoyed this book. Now I have more compassion for Prince Harry and feel like I actually know him. He pulled back the curtain on a life 99.9% of us will never know and it almost feels like a privilege to get an inside look at that royal life. For those expecting a salacious tell all that spills the royal tea, you will be disappointed. But you’ll like part 3 which covers the Meg years. The rest of the book is Prince Harry telling you about his life and experiences. Through his own lens. Imagine that. Someone telling their own story their own way. Starting in his childhood years with one of the first (painfully) pivotal moments of losing his mom, this is really a coming of age story while processing grief and trauma and living in a fish bowl. I appreciated that this memoir went in chronological order and didn’t jump around. I thought that made it very readable and you got to watch Harry’s evolution along the way: from school years to war to adulthood to true love and family. Never once did I think Harry was whining about anything. Perception is relative. There is definitely sibling rivalry between William and Harry (a lot of this in part 3) and I'd love to also hear William's side of this story. But that's a story we'll never get. The heir and the spare is a very divisive line drawn. Harry wasn't just the spare to the throne, he was there for spare parts (i.e.: if William needed a kidney or something). Imagine growing up knowing you are second best all the time. In a world where so many people loudly declare everyone should be able to live their own authentic lives, often those same people loudly declare what that should look like for some people (i.e.: the Prince Harrys and Britney Spearses of the world.) When will we actually let people decide for themselves what that should be? I really respect his decision to take control of the narrative.If you like memoirs, have an interest in a life experience other than your own, you're open minded and compassionate to others, and you have a little interest in royal life, don't miss this one.

Rating 4 out of 5,"It is weird going into a book having so many opinions on the story before reading a single word. Going in I had loyalties I wanted to defend and biases to confirm. But I also knew others had gone in similarly and had their opinions swayed. So I tried to buckle in, expecting an emotional rollercoaster. Honestly, it is so fitting that I had so many opinions going into the book, as that is one of the central themes-- existing with literally millions of people having opinions about your life. After three decades of others getting rich on spinning lies about his life and being told by his family to never share your emotions or your point of view, I hope writing this book was healing for Harry. I appreciated getting to hear his point of view and for the first person insights on his and Meghan's history-making decisions. Much of the details are enriched by watching their Netflix show, which I really recommend. People have scoffed at some of the details Harry chose to include, by I think they add to his ethos. He's not writing this to make himself look a certain way, but he's writing it to share his truth. So yeah he includes odd or embarrassing stories, but the point is, he is the one sharing them, not other people profiting off their made up version of them. This book is a great opportunity to practice duality. I can still appreciate much of the good and charity that the Royal Family does. The inner child in me can still enjoy the romanticized fantasy of it all. And I can also be disappointed that they are dysfunctional and harmful. Harry does a good job of not condemning people he very well could denounce and exhibits impressive grace and respect.I dislike that me rating this seems like a political act. I'm torn to give it 5 stars because I know so many trolls have rated it 0. But I will give it 4 because what Harry prizes in truth not popularity. Themes explored: trauma, PTSD, role of media, toxic masculinity, sibling rivalry, love, selflessness, power. But mostly it is a chronological account of his very bizarre, privileged, and difficult life. I am proud of the growth documented.

Rating 4 out of 5,"3.5 stars audiobook - This is a book about grief and PTSD and how difficult it is to heal from that when you continue to exist in an unhealthy, dysfunctional environment. Between a mother’s death, the cognitive shutdown thereafter with no psychological support, the active war assignments, the constant tabloid/paparazzi shenanigans, perpetually increased cortisol/stress levels, and no effective treatment for decades, you can see why it was time for Harry to seek treatment and walk away. You cannot heal within the same system that is hurting you. You would never tell a physically abused person to keep getting hit in the face for the next few decades. You would tell them to leave. So if psychological injuries are happening within a system - it’s the same thing. I thought of this book as a part of Harry’s therapy. A kind of journal, if you will. It just happens to be a journal he published so he can finally have some control over his own narrative. Everyone should be allowed to tell their own story if they want to. If I went up to some random stranger and just said to them out loud in public “Hey you’re the person who robbed my house last year!” I can almost guarantee you that person would immediately try to defend themselves and rightfully call me a liar - because they need to take back control of the narrative and make some corrections.So Harry is doing just that. Telling his truth. Taking control of his story from the random people (press) throwing accusations his way in public. I don’t blame him. I also think that men who think they are “tough” and don’t need anyone should take a page from his book and learn about healing their trauma. It’s not weak to cry. It’s not weak to talk to someone. That’s what proper healing looks like. Harry is open and honest. He owns his messiness and his vulnerability. And he also recognizes that there is still much that he needs to process. Maybe if we all had more introspection, recognition, and accountability humanity would be more tolerable. Side note: He’s also quite funny in parts and has an excellent grasp of irony.Show more",4,35 stars audiobook  This is a book about grief and PTSD and how difficult it is to heal from that when you continue to exist in an unhealthy dysfunctional environment Between a mothers death the cognitive shutdown thereafter with no psychological support the active war assignments the constant tabloidpaparazzi shenanigans perpetually increased cortisolstress levels and no effective treatment for decades you can see why it was time for Harry to seek treatment and walk away You cannot heal within the same system that is hurting you You would never tell a physically abused person to keep getting hit in the face for the next few decades You would tell them to leave So if psychological injuries are happening within a system  its the same thing I thought of this book as a part of Harrys therapy A kind of journal if you will It just happens to be a journal he published so he can finally have some control over his own narrative Everyone should be allowed to tell their own story if they want to If I went up to some random stranger and just said to them out loud in public Hey youre the person who robbed my house last year I can almost guarantee you that person would immediately try to defend themselves and rightfully call me a liar  because they need to take back control of the narrative and make some correctionsSo Harry is doing just that Telling his truth Taking control of his story from the random people press throwing accusations his way in public I dont blame him I also think that men who think they are tough and dont need anyone should take a page from his book and learn about healing their trauma Its not weak to cry Its not weak to talk to someone Thats what proper healing looks like Harry is open and honest He owns his messiness and his vulnerability And he also recognizes that there is still much that he needs to process Maybe if we all had more introspection recognition and accountability humanity would be more tolerable Side note Hes also quite funny in parts and has an excellent grasp of ironyShow more
Rating 4 out of 5,"About the bookWell, does this book need any introduction at all… I must admit though that I personally knew little about prince Harry’s life because I’m not keen on reading any tabloids or gossip, that’s not a big thing where I live. Prince Harry has been in the tabloids a lot, always actually, and wanted to tell his own story, his own truth. He is brutally honest and talks about his childhood missing his mum, his life in the army, his love for Africa and nature and of course finding the love of his life and trying to protect her. My thoughts about the bookSince there seems to be so much talk about this book I wanted to form my own opinion and watched Harry and Meghan’s documentary on Netflix and read this book. Do I think he shared too much personal details of other people’s lives? I do. Especially when it isn’t needed to share for his story, like the part of being in Courtney Cox’s house and taking drugs there. I don’t know what to think of the rivalry between him and his brother to be honest. Was I surprised about his life? Yes! The way paparazzi stalk the Royal family is beyond words, it should be illegal. People should stop reading that junk news to begin with so these people are out of business. I loved the parts about Africa the most, I think being there brought some normality in his life, some quietness and a way to escape the circus. I don’t think Harry is made for a life that he was born into and he certainly seems to have found peace and happiness living with Meg, and that should be just fine! It seems the book is to justify his decision but shouldn’t he be able to chose his own life? About the book itself, I found the chapters a bit short and there are so many this way, but the story is intriguing, well written and hard to put down. I’ve partially listened to the audio version and think he could easily narrate a story for the Calm app, he has a great voice for it! I think you should read the book before you form an opinion about someone you don’t know, for me it was an interesting read.Show more",4,About the bookWell does this book need any introduction at all I must admit though that I personally knew little about prince Harrys life because Im not keen on reading any tabloids or gossip thats not a big thing where I live Prince Harry has been in the tabloids a lot always actually and wanted to tell his own story his own truth He is brutally honest and talks about his childhood missing his mum his life in the army his love for Africa and nature and of course finding the love of his life and trying to protect her My thoughts about the bookSince there seems to be so much talk about this book I wanted to form my own opinion and watched Harry and Meghans documentary on Netflix and read this book Do I think he shared too much personal details of other peoples lives I do Especially when it isnt needed to share for his story like the part of being in Courtney Coxs house and taking drugs there I dont know what to think of the rivalry between him and his brother to be honest Was I surprised about his life Yes The way paparazzi stalk the Royal family is beyond words it should be illegal People should stop reading that junk news to begin with so these people are out of business I loved the parts about Africa the most I think being there brought some normality in his life some quietness and a way to escape the circus I dont think Harry is made for a life that he was born into and he certainly seems to have found peace and happiness living with Meg and that should be just fine It seems the book is to justify his decision but shouldnt he be able to chose his own life About the book itself I found the chapters a bit short and there are so many this way but the story is intriguing well written and hard to put down Ive partially listened to the audio version and think he could easily narrate a story for the Calm app he has a great voice for it I think you should read the book before you form an opinion about someone you dont know for me it was an interesting readShow more
Rating 1 out of 5,"Hard to put into words how awful this book is. Why did I read this book? Well, I’ve always been intrigued with the royals. I think most of the world is. I still remember when Princess Diana died. There is so much dignity, reverence, mystery, hundreds of years of tradition and even sprinkles of magic associated with the family who is famously tight lipped. It’s why we all watch these Royal weddings and pay respects when one of them dies. We want the tea! We want all the juicy details— but they will never give it to us! So we come crawling back for whatever little bits they throw our way. Also, The Crown! Well this book takes away ALL of these dignified notions associated with royalty. Harry reduces his family so far as to rival Kardashian level TV drama. Talks about copious drug use, losing his virginity (even when and where 😳), sibling rivalry (over and over and over again on this one) down to who got the bigger room growing up, antics at his preppy expensive boarding school, entirely too detailed military experiences, and finally, each and every single time his wife Meghan felt at all uncomfortable or slighted by his family (like the time Kate made a face when Meghan asked to borrow some chapstick— yes even this made an entire page of his book!!!).It’s all a bit much.

Rating 5 out of 5,"This is probably the most I’ve savored a book. I didn’t want to rush through it but really wanted to enjoy each part. This book is so beautifully and thoughtfully written that I think flying through it may not do it justice. Let me just start by saying that Harry has such a way with words. Some memoirs really miss the mark when they end up choppy and sound like they were written by a child. (Ahem..bad editing!) However, this book was such a breath of fresh air on many accounts. I feel as though I really got to know the heart and soul of Prince Harry. The way in which he shares memories both big, small, and in between gave me such a feel for what he likely experienced from childhood through adolescence and upward. His writing is humble—he isn’t afraid to bring up his big mess ups and failures. He owns them and seems to always intend to grow from them. I cannot even begin to fathom what this man went through with the death of his mother at such a young age, being in the (way too bright) spotlight, and being viewed as the “spare” or back up to his brother William, the heir. He dives into the different ways this impacted him. It would be difficult not to empathize with his situation. You may have guessed that I was already a huge Harry and Meghan fan going into this book, and you’d be right. I didn’t think it was possible to love them more but I most certainly do. These two are perfectly imperfect human beings, just like us all, that fell in love, made a family, and realized their values were different than the royal family traditions. It’s all too easy for people to judge them (hey, I can be judgmental too!) but reading this book may offer you a different perspective than you’ve considered before. If you already adore Prince Harry, I think you’ll adore this book just the same! And if you’re not a fan of Prince Harry, I would challenge you to go in with as much an open mind as possible. Lastly, I know everyone thinks that Meghan “ruined” Harry, but I feel quite the opposite. She has brought out a side of Harry that I think any woman would long to see in a man. He has committed his life to his wife and children above all, put his wife’s mental health and well-being above his royal duties, and shown that he will stand up for what is right and fight for change even if it means being ostracized and basically removed from his extended family. Now that is what I call a man!Show more",5,This is probably the most Ive savored a book I didnt want to rush through it but really wanted to enjoy each part This book is so beautifully and thoughtfully written that I think flying through it may not do it justice Let me just start by saying that Harry has such a way with words Some memoirs really miss the mark when they end up choppy and sound like they were written by a child Ahembad editing However this book was such a breath of fresh air on many accounts I feel as though I really got to know the heart and soul of Prince Harry The way in which he shares memories both big small and in between gave me such a feel for what he likely experienced from childhood through adolescence and upward His writing is humblehe isnt afraid to bring up his big mess ups and failures He owns them and seems to always intend to grow from them I cannot even begin to fathom what this man went through with the death of his mother at such a young age being in the way too bright spotlight and being viewed as the spare or back up to his brother William the heir He dives into the different ways this impacted him It would be difficult not to empathize with his situation You may have guessed that I was already a huge Harry and Meghan fan going into this book and youd be right I didnt think it was possible to love them more but I most certainly do These two are perfectly imperfect human beings just like us all that fell in love made a family and realized their values were different than the royal family traditions Its all too easy for people to judge them hey I can be judgmental too but reading this book may offer you a different perspective than youve considered before If you already adore Prince Harry I think youll adore this book just the same And if youre not a fan of Prince Harry I would challenge you to go in with as much an open mind as possible Lastly I know everyone thinks that Meghan ruined Harry but I feel quite the opposite She has brought out a side of Harry that I think any woman would long to see in a man He has committed his life to his wife and children above all put his wifes mental health and wellbeing above his royal duties and shown that he will stand up for what is right and fight for change even if it means being ostracized and basically removed from his extended family Now that is what I call a manShow more
Rating 4 out of 5,"It might be Harry’s own truth, but I have a feeling that this is as close as we will get to the ins and outs of the House of Windsor. A stoic, detached extended family. An emotionally unavailable father. An older sibling who has also been traumatized from the same things as Prince Harry, but it seems they never coped about it the same way. Never supported each other. I find it tragic that they can never be their true selves, especially amongst each other. It seems so absurd that they are trying to hold on to something so outdated, so trivial in the grand scheme of things. How are they better than the Kardashians? No matter who is right or wrong, the way they feed the press, the documentaries, the public appearances, in this century they are no more than reality tv stars. Bounding themselves to a set of rules that’s so archaic that even they think of it as painfully nonsensical. They can’t explain it, it’s just the way it is! They are no more than circus clowns who happen to live in a castle, but they are dying to be the most beloved, most talked about clown of them all! If they were not so caught up on continuing the “legacy”, if they talked to each other more, hugged each other more, and frankly, if they had some sort of therapy - they would maybe become a functioning family. Harry may break the cycle, time will tell, but no hope in sight for William and Kate’s poor kids. As for the book, I enjoyed Harry’s childhood chapters up until he joined the army, then it dragged on a bit. But I appreciated the vulnerability he showed and his willingness to share the embarrassing parts of his life. In context they are not as controversial as the media reports it to be. For example, the frostbitten part is not meant to be a “ha ha what a funny thing that will shock everyone!” type of story. It’s meant to show how Harry even couldn’t tell his father and brother what was wrong with him, how he couldn’t go to anyone in the palace or any doctor because people would find out about it and it would make the news immediately. I dived into this excited for the tea - and I am leaving with pity for everyone who’s involved in this circus show.

Rating 3 out of 5,"I have many conflicting feelings about this book. On the one hand, I think Harry is a caring and truly decent guy who was extremely traumatized by the early loss of his mother. He really never grieved, just denied her death for years. Additionally, being told he was the Spare from his youngest years, even by his beloved mother, was incredibly damaging to his sense of self, and the ruthless and relentless hounding he received at the hands of the press exacerbated that damage. All of this together, combined with a total lack of professional counseling throughout his growing up years and compounded by his perceived lack of support, indeed even outright betrayal, by his family, prevented Harry from finding his purpose, the meaning in his life. ""More than most people I needed a guide, a guru--a partner.""Harry readily admits throughout the book that he and William, he and his father, don't understand each other, and that's evident. It seems clear that Charles is insecure, desperate for approval at any price, and while he's a well-intended father, he's largely absent and not a strong role model or emotional support to his boys. But I think what Harry is missing is the unrelenting pressure on William as the Heir. Yes it may be difficult to be the Spare, but I'm not so sure being the Heir is all that great either. Especially in these times, when the role and value of the monarchy are tenuous. William too lost his beloved mother at a young age and was left to navigate that on his own, all while constantly needing to live up to the expectations imposed by his role as future king. It's understandable but heartbreaking that these traumas have pulled the brothers apart rather than united them.One thing that I found to be extremely tone deaf was that Harry seems utterly oblivious to his extraordinary privilege; the descriptions of his life, his surroundings, his travel are jarring, yet he never seems to notice. He's hurt and consumed by the hardships he's suffered, and he's undoubtedly suffered hardships, but he seems to focus completely on those, never looking at the uniquely luxurious life that he's living, and how very few people enjoy even a fraction of that. There's value in Harry having written this book, especially for him to feel that he has at last had his say. And really I didn't find it as scandalous as the tabloids would have you believe. His love for his family and his respect for the Crown are evident on every page. But he presents the members of the royal family as flawed human beings, behaving in ways both good and bad. Like all of us. Families are complicated and messy, and it's refreshing to see that the royals are no different than anyone else.Harry and Meghan did what they felt they needed to do for their family, as most of us would. Whether you love them or hate them, Spare provides unprecedented insight into their experience and into life in the royal family.Show more",3,I have many conflicting feelings about this book On the one hand I think Harry is a caring and truly decent guy who was extremely traumatized by the early loss of his mother He really never grieved just denied her death for years Additionally being told he was the Spare from his youngest years even by his beloved mother was incredibly damaging to his sense of self and the ruthless and relentless hounding he received at the hands of the press exacerbated that damage All of this together combined with a total lack of professional counseling throughout his growing up years and compounded by his perceived lack of support indeed even outright betrayal by his family prevented Harry from finding his purpose the meaning in his life More than most people I needed a guide a gurua partnerHarry readily admits throughout the book that he and William he and his father dont understand each other and thats evident It seems clear that Charles is insecure desperate for approval at any price and while hes a wellintended father hes largely absent and not a strong role model or emotional support to his boys But I think what Harry is missing is the unrelenting pressure on William as the Heir Yes it may be difficult to be the Spare but Im not so sure being the Heir is all that great either Especially in these times when the role and value of the monarchy are tenuous William too lost his beloved mother at a young age and was left to navigate that on his own all while constantly needing to live up to the expectations imposed by his role as future king Its understandable but heartbreaking that these traumas have pulled the brothers apart rather than united themOne thing that I found to be extremely tone deaf was that Harry seems utterly oblivious to his extraordinary privilege the descriptions of his life his surroundings his travel are jarring yet he never seems to notice Hes hurt and consumed by the hardships hes suffered and hes undoubtedly suffered hardships but he seems to focus completely on those never looking at the uniquely luxurious life that hes living and how very few people enjoy even a fraction of that Theres value in Harry having written this book especially for him to feel that he has at last had his say And really I didnt find it as scandalous as the tabloids would have you believe His love for his family and his respect for the Crown are evident on every page But he presents the members of the royal family as flawed human beings behaving in ways both good and bad Like all of us Families are complicated and messy and its refreshing to see that the royals are no different than anyone elseHarry and Meghan did what they felt they needed to do for their family as most of us would Whether you love them or hate them Spare provides unprecedented insight into their experience and into life in the royal familyShow more
Rating 2 out of 5,"Rating: 2.5 I’ll admit it. The hype got the best of me. I have previously commented that I should stop reading celebrity memoirs because rarely do I come out enjoying the author more, as a person, than when I went into the book. Prince Harry is no exception. I went in ready to hear his story and now I have some empathy for him but it’s pretty limited. There are many brazen accusations that the internet has already covered but I wish the accusations came with a shred of evidence. He is quick to explain how no one can know how he is feeling but also makes assumptions to others’ motives and their thoughts on a topic. “Willy obviously thought this…” or “Pa must have been behind that…”. There’s suspicion, paranoia, and conjecture, for sure, but honestly, can you blame him? Based on his experiences, perceptions, and stories, I didn’t but I also didn’t find it to be him to be a reliable narrator as a result. The language is uneven and disjointed. It bounces between eloquent and immature. He can be funny as well as cringeworthy. He’s a mischievous joker in one breath but feeble victim in the next. He will tell us that he has no ability to recount details other than spatial ones and then verbatim relay a private conversation from years ago. I found that to be difficult to digest but harder yet to empathize with. I was surprised to find myself also gaining a lot of empathy for King Charles and Prince William throughout this story. Do we trust Harry’s word? I think if you want to, you will. If you don’t want to, you won’t. For me, it’s a mixed bag. I’m not sure this book will enlighten anyone into Royal back room dealings or fix their own familial relationships. It’s a sad mess for everyone and I wouldn’t recommend it… both the lifestyle AND this book.Background: I am an American with no UK blood running through my veins.

Rating 4 out of 5,"If you go into “Spare” baring negative preconceived notions, you’ll be royally mistaken. The first thing you notice about the book is it’s incredibly well written. Not sure if Prince Harry had a ghost writer, but they did a bang-up job at creating a poignant and sympathetic portrayal of Britain’s second favorite son. Some observations I made from the text:-Had a lifelong hatred for the press, even before his mother’s passing. He recalls a time when they followed Princess Di’s car, shoving cameras into the windows as she openly wept in front of the paparazzi. -Conducted a lifelong feud with Rupert Murdoch, suing his media network on numerous occasions. -Obsessed with LEGO Batman. -Admitted to 25 confirmed kills. -Doesn’t shy away from his blatant and alcohol use. Most incidents was to let off steam from press or ptsd from battle. -Strong proponent for preservation. Documents numerous trips helping out elephants and rhinos. -Yes, he did put the same balm his mother used on her lips all over his “tosher”. Bad frost bite from the North Pole wouldn’t go away during his brother’s wedding. Desperate times call for desperate measures. -Visited both poles. -A former girlfriend committed suicide because of press attention. -Lost a baby with Meghan because of press attention. -Lost his mother because of press attention. -Never hugged either the former queen or the current king, though he had a decent relationship with both. -Wasn’t as close to William as everyone made out, especially after he was wed. Both had friends as their best men, not each other. -Documents numerous occasions when William attacked him. -Did everything he could to stay in the war, but various fatwas and attacks pushed him out. -Endured torture and a wilderness safety routine to pass different physical tests. -Slipped into Meghan’s dm’s on insta. It’s how they first met. -Fled Canada before Covid closed the borders. Sure, there’s a lot of dirty laundry airing, but wouldn’t you if you were offered $40 million? It’s a hotly anticipated memoir that definitively deserves the hype.

Rating 2 out of 5,"okay so i don't really give a shit about the royal family, i only really read this book because i wanted to know the tea and the controversy that everyone was talking about and tbh i got that bc reading it was actually pretty entertaining. i don't think it's objectively a good book, and i do not support the monarchy, but honestly some of the stuff he wrote about was so funny like i was just laughing because of the amount of oversharing on certain things (*cough* frost nipped dick *cough*). the book kind of flipped between being interesting to boring (especially the military, army, and airplane flying parts) and interesting to boring again and again, so i feel like that's why it took me a while to get through, other than the fact that i was listening to the audiobook of it and i was busy. it was cool to hear it from his voice though, i like that about audiobooks. i was expecting him to trash the royal family a lot in the book, at first it was very subtle and not that much because i suppose he was a child and didn't realise, until the 3rd part of the book when he met meghan. mostly throughout the entire book, he trashed the press and the media, which is fair, because they did some really, really awful things. something i did actually like about this book was when he talked about his mum princess diana, it was just really sad, and say what you want about him i don't really care, but losing your mum at such a young age is something that any human person should be able to sympathise with. i liked how he started being able to talk about her more as he got older and the book progressed, and it was really sweet the way he described her and how much he missed her, it's really sad. also, the scenes with him and his brother prince william were interesting and also it's sad to see that they were once so close but they've become so broken apart by this whole feud and it kind of shows how the monarchy breaks people and relationships so easily. overall i don't really have any strong opinions on harry/meghan but yeah this book was okay i guess lolShow more",2,okay so i dont really give a shit about the royal family i only really read this book because i wanted to know the tea and the controversy that everyone was talking about and tbh i got that bc reading it was actually pretty entertaining i dont think its objectively a good book and i do not support the monarchy but honestly some of the stuff he wrote about was so funny like i was just laughing because of the amount of oversharing on certain things cough frost nipped dick cough the book kind of flipped between being interesting to boring especially the military army and airplane flying parts and interesting to boring again and again so i feel like thats why it took me a while to get through other than the fact that i was listening to the audiobook of it and i was busy it was cool to hear it from his voice though i like that about audiobooks i was expecting him to trash the royal family a lot in the book at first it was very subtle and not that much because i suppose he was a child and didnt realise until the 3rd part of the book when he met meghan mostly throughout the entire book he trashed the press and the media which is fair because they did some really really awful things something i did actually like about this book was when he talked about his mum princess diana it was just really sad and say what you want about him i dont really care but losing your mum at such a young age is something that any human person should be able to sympathise with i liked how he started being able to talk about her more as he got older and the book progressed and it was really sweet the way he described her and how much he missed her its really sad also the scenes with him and his brother prince william were interesting and also its sad to see that they were once so close but theyve become so broken apart by this whole feud and it kind of shows how the monarchy breaks people and relationships so easily overall i dont really have any strong opinions on harrymeghan but yeah this book was okay i guess lolShow more
Rating 2 out of 5,"The first 60% of this book was a slog to get through, and in my opinion contained way too many unnecessary anecdotes. I was ready to excuse it's poor construction with the assumption that Harry was at least building towards a thesis that the entire royal institution was outdated and in need of a revamp, but that idea goes out the window in the last few pages. I guess it was too much to ask for him to completely denounce his family's institution, although he does a good job vilifying just about every member of the family (excluding his beloved grandmother) anyway.I found myself genuinely frustrated at how close he comes to getting it: throughout the entire book, we're confronted with how the royal institution forced him to grow up too fast, indirectly killed his mother, endangered his wife and then refused to protect her in any meaningful way, and prevented him from gaining any valuable job or life skills before completely cutting him off. Seemingly every problem in his life, including his inability to find emotional support and physical comfort from his family following the traumatic loss of his mother, stems from their status as royals. Ah, but he loves his grandmother, and the royals are so good for tourism, so who can really say if it's worth it after all? Yawn.Out of all the interviews where Harry & Meghan talk about their conflict with the family, Spare is definitely the most outright disparaging towards William & Kate; we see virtually no redeeming qualities in the older brother at any point in the novel. While I don't find it hard to believe that Willy, the heir to Harry's titular spare, carries around a sense of entitlement and toxic brotherly competition, I felt that his characterization was a bit too exaggerated to be believable, and the anecdotes we were given were absolutely cherry picked to portray him in the worst light possible. The last 40% of this novel read more like a fairy tale, with the forbidden love and evil stepmother and happily ever after to cap it all off. But at least it was entertaining, a much needed contrast to the previous 300 pages.At the end of the day, I do feel for what Harry & Meghan have been forced through in the past four years, and on some level I can see why Harry felt the need to release his own version of events. I just didn't need to read about him doing shrooms in Courtney Cox's house.Show more",2,The first 60 of this book was a slog to get through and in my opinion contained way too many unnecessary anecdotes I was ready to excuse its poor construction with the assumption that Harry was at least building towards a thesis that the entire royal institution was outdated and in need of a revamp but that idea goes out the window in the last few pages I guess it was too much to ask for him to completely denounce his familys institution although he does a good job vilifying just about every member of the family excluding his beloved grandmother anywayI found myself genuinely frustrated at how close he comes to getting it throughout the entire book were confronted with how the royal institution forced him to grow up too fast indirectly killed his mother endangered his wife and then refused to protect her in any meaningful way and prevented him from gaining any valuable job or life skills before completely cutting him off Seemingly every problem in his life including his inability to find emotional support and physical comfort from his family following the traumatic loss of his mother stems from their status as royals Ah but he loves his grandmother and the royals are so good for tourism so who can really say if its worth it after all YawnOut of all the interviews where Harry  Meghan talk about their conflict with the family Spare is definitely the most outright disparaging towards William  Kate we see virtually no redeeming qualities in the older brother at any point in the novel While I dont find it hard to believe that Willy the heir to Harrys titular spare carries around a sense of entitlement and toxic brotherly competition I felt that his characterization was a bit too exaggerated to be believable and the anecdotes we were given were absolutely cherry picked to portray him in the worst light possible The last 40 of this novel read more like a fairy tale with the forbidden love and evil stepmother and happily ever after to cap it all off But at least it was entertaining a much needed contrast to the previous 300 pagesAt the end of the day I do feel for what Harry  Meghan have been forced through in the past four years and on some level I can see why Harry felt the need to release his own version of events I just didnt need to read about him doing shrooms in Courtney Coxs houseShow more
